2993,"Forget a data breach, consumers give away their personal information on social media","In the wake of the Equifax data breach, consumers more at risk Six months after the Equifax data breach, consumers are doing little to protect themselves from scammers. In fact, they may be giving up even more personal data now without realizing it. 4:58 PM ET Fri, 9 March 2018 | 02:46 
When it comes to identity theft, you may be putting yourself at risk without realizing it. 
""Putting too much personal information out on social media is the most egregious example"" of how consumers set themselves up, according to Jeff Faulkner, acting president and CEO of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, or NFCC. 
In the wake of the Equifax data breach, such personal details like where you grew up, where you vacation and who your friends are — which are all easily found on Facebook and Instagram — may be the missing link scammers need to access your accounts, he said. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images 
It's been six months since hackers stole the personal data Equifax had collected on more than 143 million Americans . Last week, the credit monitoring firm said an additional 2.4 million Americans were affected. 
In total, roughly 147.9 million Americans have been hit by the hack. It remains the largest data breach of personal information. 
Yet there have been many others as well. 
""The Equifax breach was the mother of all breaches but there have been breaches all along,"" Faulkner said. In fact, there are roughly over 1,500 breaches a year, the NFCC said. 
In the year before the Equifax hack, about 15.4 million consumers were victims of identity theft or fraud in 2016, according to a separate report from Javelin Strategy & Research, and that was a 16 percent increase from 2015. 
And still, most people still have not taken steps to find out whether their information is at risk . Half of U.S. adults said they have not looked at their credit report or credit score since the Equifax breach, according to a recent survey by CreditCards.com . Eighteen percent of adults have never checked their credit report or credit score, the report said. ""We need to be doing everything we can to protect ourselves, I can't stress that enough."" -Jeff Faulkner, CEO of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling 
Faulkner recommends setting up notifications to track credit card transactions, checking your existing credit accounts for suspicious activity and pulling credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com to check for new accounts in your name as well as putting a short-term or longer-term fraud alert on your report, which is free. The alert means that a lender seeking to approve an application must first contact you to verify the request is from you, not an imposter trying to take out a loan or credit card. 
(For now, putting a more permanent credit freeze on your account can come at a cost, although Congress is considering a bill which would make credit-data freezes free across the board.) 
""We need to be doing everything we can to protect ourselves, I can't stress that enough,"" Faulkner said.

5512,Trump tells reporters NAFTA deal is 'pretty close',"A deal on NAFTA is ""getting pretty close,"" President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday.
But, he added, a renegotiated trade deal with Mexico and Canada is probably ""weeks or months away."" 
The seemingly contradictory guidance comes as Vice President Mike Pence is set to head to the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru, where he will meet with leaders from around the region this weekend. Trump canceled plans to attend himself earlier this week. He was expected to use the meeting to show a sign of progress with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts on renegotiating the 24-year-old trade deal.
Trump told the White House press corps on Thursday there wasn't a timeline for NAFTA talks. Signs of progress have emerged in recent days, as the parties push to get something finished before Mexico's presidential election in July.
GOP lawmakers have been concerned about the Trump administration's escalating trade rhetoric with China and its effect on American agriculture. The U.S. farm belt could be particularly hard hit by a trade war with China, which has threatened retaliatory tariffs on a range of farm products.
Trump said that although farmers have been hurt by bad trade deals, China is now selling a lot of U.S. beef because of a conversation he had with China's President Xi Jinping.",2018-04-12T18:47:00.000+03:00

1191,Former market-topping money manager Jeff Vinik says we're in the '7th or 8th inning' of the rally,"Market-beating money manager Jeff Vinik is bullish on stocks for now, but warns we are in the latter stages of the market rally.
""We've got a huge amount of momentum, not only market momentum, but economic momentum right now. The Trump tax cuts are certainly a tailwind for us. Worldwide, the economy is very strong, inflation is low. Short term these are very good conditions for the economy and for stocks,"" he said in an interview Friday on CNBC's "" Halftime Report ."" ""If you look at a longer term basis, I start to get a little bit cautious. ... Don't fight the momentum right now, but we're probably in the later stages, 7th or 8th inning.""
The S&P 500 is up 24 percent in the past 12 months. The current bull market started in 2009.
Vinik said ironically all the positive data on investor sentiment, corporate earnings and consumer confidence worries him.
""There is a good amount of euphoria out there,"" he said. ""I don't remember a time honestly, maybe back to 2000, when there was so much good news and so much bullishness. And every instinct of mine tells me when that is the case, you should be a little cautious.""
From 1992 to 1996, Vinik managed the Fidelity Magellan Fund, the world's largest mutual fund at the time with more than $50 billion under management. He then started his hedge fund Vinik Asset Management and posted annual returns of 17 percent before closing it in 2013. Vinik is the owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League.

5772,LendingClub plunges after FTC charges the online lender of 'deceiving customers',"LendingClub plunged as much as 17 percent on Wednesday after the Federal Trade Commission alleged that the online lender ""deceived customers"" on its fee structure.
LendingClub sold users on loans with ""no hidden fees,"" but actually collected ""hundreds or even thousands of dollars in hidden up-front fees from the loans,"" the agency said in a statement.
In its complaint, the FTC said LendingClub knew it was creating problems for consumers and likely misleading them.
It's the latest setback for LendingClub, whose founder was ousted in 2016 after an investigation determined that company employees knowingly sold loans to an investor that did not meet the backer's criteria.
The company pioneered the model of issuing consumer loans over the internet and selling the high-yield debt to investors through a marketplace.
LendingClub shares fell as low as $2.69 immediately following Wednesday's announcement. The stock is down more than 50 percent in the past year and has lost 80 percent of its value since the company went public in late 2014.
LendingClub's website and advertising materials told users there wouldn't be hidden fees. But often users received loans for a smaller amount than they'd applied for, the FTC said, because LendingClub would take a percentage of the loan after a bank had released the money but before LendingClub transferred it to the applicant.
The FTC also said LendingClub falsely told applicants their loans had been backed by investors even though the applicants still had to pass multiple rounds of approval. LendingClub congratulated applicants on their forthcoming funds when it knew many of them would never get a loan, the FTC said.
""This case demonstrates the importance to consumers of having truthful information from lenders, including online marketplace lenders,"" Reilly Dolan, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in the statement. ""Stopping this kind of conduct will help consumers make informed choices about loan offers.""
LendingClub called the allegations ""legally and factually unwarranted,"" and said in a statement that ""it intends to oppose the claims and work towards an early resolution of the matter in Federal Court.""
The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division.",2018-04-25T21:02:00.000+03:00
5293,Zuora prices IPO at $14 per share — valuing the company at $1.44 billion,"Technology company Zuora on Wednesday priced its initial public offering at $14 per share, a day before the company expects its stock to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
At that price, the company has an implied valuation of $1.44 billion. The results suggest investors believe there is still interest in young technology companies that seek to be traded on public markets.
Zuora, which provides tools like billing and analytics systems that companies can use to sell subscription services, first filed to go public on March 16. The company's competitors include Oracle and SAP . Apttus, another competitor, has been planning to go public .
On April 2, the company issued the first range for its pricing, indicating it expected shares to be sold for between $9 and $11 per share. On Tuesday, the company raised the range with an estimate of $11 to $13 per share.
Zuora sold 11 million shares at $14 per share, meaning the company has raised $154 million, following several rounds of venture capital deals since being founded in 2006. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the joint bookrunners in the deal, Zuora said in a statement on Wednesday.
Cloud software company Dropbox went public last month, and shares are up 11 percent over the debut price of $29 . Spotify also recently began trading through a direct listing, although shares are down almost 10 percent since the debut price of $165.90 per share. Meanwhile, smaller technology companies like DocuSign , Pivotal and Smartsheet have filed to go public in recent weeks.

1542,Brazilian stocks are surging right now after court upholds ex-president Lula's conviction,"Brazilian stocks jumped on Wednesday after an appeals court upheld a corruption conviction for former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
If Lula is barred from the election, current President Michel Temer likely has an easier path towards re-election. Temer is seen as the more market-friendly option between the two. He has also pushed for reforms to the country's pension system.
The iShares MSCI Brazil exchange-traded fund ( EWZ ) spiked 6.2 percent higher on the back of the news. Brazil's Bovespa index, meanwhile, rose 3.4 percent and hit an all-time high.
The EWZ also posted its biggest one-day gain since May 19, 2017.

Da Silva, better known as Lula, was convicted last year of corruption. He is also the highest-profile casualty of ""Operação Lava Jato"" (Operation Car Wash), a sweeping corruption investigation that has rattled Brazil.
Since its start in 2014, Operation Car Wash has led to hundreds of arrests. It also led to Dilma Rousseff's ousting as Brazil's president in 2016. Rousseff succeeded Lula in 2011.
The court's unanimous decision reduces Lula's options to appeal against the conviction. He is also likely to be declared if he tries to register his candidacy for the Oct. 7 presidential election.
Lula, who was Brazil's president for two consecutive terms, was one of the most popular Brazilian politicians in recent memory. Former U.S. President Barack Obama once labeled him the most popular politician on earth. When he left office, Lula had an 83 percent approval rating.
The former union leader won global admiration for transformative social policies that helped reduce stinging inequality in Latin America's biggest country.

3301,Paralympic medalist says to quit this common habit if you want to be successful,"CNBC.com Getty Images | Nicholas Hunt 
As Paralympians compete for gold in Pyeongchang, South Korea, medalist Bonnie St. John has advice for those who want to succeed: Never ask for permission. 
At age 19 during the 1984 Paralympics in Innsbruck, Austria, St. John became the first African-American to win medals at the Winter Paralympics. She won a silver (overall performance) and two bronze medals (one in slalom and the other in giant slalom). 
She went on to attend Harvard where she graduated Magna Cum Laude with a degree in economics. Shortly thereafter, St. John was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, one of the world's most prestigious scholarships, to attend Oxford University where she again studied economics. 
So how did this self-described ""one-legged black girl from San Diego"" go on to achieve so much, after having her right leg amputated at age five? 
St. John tells CNBC Make It that her many accomplishments are due to the fact that she never asks for permission. 
In fact, asking for permission is the biggest hindrance to success, according to the Paralympian who has worked at IBM and in the White House as the director for human capital issues under the Clinton administration 
She adds that she sees this common habit most often among females, in her current job as a leadership consultant for Fortune 500 companies. 
In this role, St. John works with women in senior positions on how to ""find their voice and max their contribution"" within the company — a task which many women find hard to do. 
""Women are conditioned to be asked,"" she says. ""Men raise their hands and just do it."" 
St. John says that at every point in her life, no matter what obstacles arose, she simply did whatever it took to accomplish her set goal. However, she says, many women live and work in a ""permission space"" where they feel arrogant if they don't ask for approval. 
""Men don't have this issue,"" says St. John, ""And you see it even more so for multicultural women. You're not supposed to stand out. You're supposed to be submissive."" 
Women need to stop seeking permission and validation, she says, and must go after things ""with drive and a positive outlook."" 
St. John points to her own experience growing up. Her father left before she was born and her mother was forced to raise three children on her own. In school, she was excused from physical education due to her missing leg and she was unable to play games like hopscotch with the other students during recess. 
""I was not an athlete. I was the crippled kid,"" she says. But even then she knew that she wanted a better life for herself. 
St. John was first introduced to skiing when a high school friend invited her on a ski trip. 
""I decided to try it because it was my chance to be an athlete and to feel the wind in my hair,"" she says. "" I was awful."" 
Still, that didn't deter her from practicing and she quickly improved. But being a good skier wasn't good enough for her, she says. She wanted to be a champion. 
St. John decided to apply to the Burke Mountain Academy, a high school in Vermont for ski racers where tuition was $10,000. She says that there was no way her mother could afford the pricey tuition. 
In order to raise the money, she typed up signs on carbon paper requesting donations. In the end, she made a grand total of $100, she says. However, she was admitted to the school after receiving financial assistance from the National Brotherhood of Skiers, an organization of African-American skiers. 
During that first week of school, she says, her prosthetic leg broke. She quickly ordered a new one, which then got lost in the mail. But once her leg arrived, says St. John, it was go-time. 
The amputee endured long painful training sessions, she says, and went on to qualify for the 1984 U.S. Paralympic Ski Team. She made history as the first ever African-American to win Olympic medals in ski racing. 
After winning three medals, she focused on academics and interned at the investment banking firm Morgan Stanley . 
""Keeping your head in the game is the same in sports as it is in work and life,"" says St. John.",2018-03-11T15:00:00.000+02:00
3324,Amazon is hiring a former FDA official to work on its secretive health tech business,"Amazon 's Grand Challenge team, its equivalent of the Google X lab for moonshot technologies, has made its latest high-profile health care hire.
The company has quietly scooped up Taha Kass-Hout, the former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief health informatics officer, according to a source with knowledge of the hire.
Kass-Hout will serve in a business development role focusing on health care projects. He will work alongside Amazon Grand Challenge chief Babak Parviz , a former director at Google X who joined Amazon in 2014 as a vice president.
Amazon has remained secretive about its health care ambitions, with a few exceptions.
It did announce a collaboration with J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to bring down health care costs and improve quality for its own employees. But it hasn't said much about how that will work, or who will run it.
Amazon's Grand Challenge team has also been referred to internally as 1492 . Like Google X, it is focused on very big bets that would potentially create a new category for the business. The multi-trillion dollar health sector is a major focus for the group.
Amazon did not immediately return a request for comment.
""Empowering consumers"" Kass-Hout left his previous role at Michigan's Trinity Health in May of last year, and hasn't updated his LinkedIn profile since then.
At Trinity, where he served as a senior vice president, his role involved ""leadership and oversight over data, analytics and digital health initiatives,"" according to his profile.
Prior than that, he worked in senior government roles at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA as its first executive focused on health informatics. He's also a Harvard-trained physician.
His expertise is in health information technologies and digital health, as well as in navigating government regulation.
Most interestingly, he describes his mission on LinkedIn as ""empowering consumers via sustainable health data ecosystems.""
That suggests Amazon might be looking to help consumers get easier access to health records. Both Apple and Alphabet have launched initiatives to help consumers gain access to their medical information, which is currently scattered across various health systems.
It's a big problem — and a big opportunity for technology companies. More than 250,000 people die every year from medical errors, often resulting from a lack of available patient-data on hospital computer systems. Amazon hasn't revealed its own ambitions in this space, but CNBC reported that it's looking at opportunities to push and pull data from legacy electronic medical systems .
Medical experts say that it's also possible that Kass-Hout will help Amazon through various facets of the regulatory process, especially if it brings new health hardware or software to market.
""It's not clear either way, but it does at least give them the option,"" said Stephen Buck, a former co-founder of GoodRx, which gives consumers a platform for cheaper medicines. Buck did not have any inside knowledge of the hire.
""It's smart of Amazon to bring in people well versed in health care data and how connectivity is vital to improving results,"" he added.
Amazon has various teams working internally on a wide variety different health projects, some of which may never reach production.
For instance, it has teams focused on bringing its Alexa voice assistant to health care, figuring out whether it can disrupt the drug supply chain, and selling medical supplies to hospitals. Amazon Web Services is working to serve its customers in the health care sector with cloud technology, and has a deal with Cerner to help better use their data to make health predictions about patient populations.
In addition to Kass-Hout, Amazon this year also scooped up Martin Levine , a prominent Seattle-based geriatrician with an expertise in innovative care delivery models.",2018-03-16T23:14:00.000+02:00
2539,FCC chair defends reversal of Obama online rules — internet works despite 'fear mongering',"The Trump administration's approach to a fair and open internet seeks a compromise between too much regulation and too little, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told CNBC on Tuesday.
""Some people said that we should maintain the rules we had, the heavy-handed regulations that were based in the 1930s,"" Pai said in an interview from the Mobile World Congress gathering in Barcelona, Spain. ""Others said we should wipe the slate clean, have no regulations whatsoever. We charted a middle course.""
Making good on President Donald Trump 's campaign promises to wipe out Obama -era regulations, the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission voted in December to eliminate the Open Internet Order, better known as ""net neutrality"" rules. The reversal of the 2015 order requiring internet service providers to treat all online traffic equally gives those companies more power to set pricing and prioritize different types of internet traffic.
Pai said on ""Squawk Box"" that he's looking to counter the ""misinformation"" that's produced this is the ""'end of the internet as we know it'"" type headlines.
""I think 2½ months later people are still using the internet. The internet still works,"" he said. ""The online experience is going to continue to get better.""
The FCC wants a ""transparency rule"" requiring internet service providers to disclose business and network management practices ""backed up by Federal Trade Commission enforcement ,"" Pai said. ""That is the kind of careful approach that gave us the internet economy in the United States that's become the envy of the world.""
Pai said he hopes Congress can come together to craft the new rules of the internet that protect consumers and competition while making sure regulations don't stifle innovation.
Critics argue the Trump administration's approach could lead internet service providers to block content, ""throttle"" down traffic, and charge for ""fast lanes"" to deliver certain types of content more quickly. Supporters of the FCC's move contend those concerns are unfounded and the marketplace will keep the industry in check. 
""I think as time goes on some of the fearmongering is going to be proven to be baseless,"" Pai said. ""Everyone, I think, wants an open internet and more infrastructure investment in the United States and around the world.""
show chapters FCC's Ajit Pai: Regulators should focus on merits of M&A      10 Hours Ago | 01:33 In Tuesday's CNBC interview, Pai was also asked about Comcast 's offer to pay $31 billion to buy Sky , outbidding a deal to take over the European pay-TV group by Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox .
Pai said it's too soon to comment directly on U.S.-based Comcast's offer for Sky, but added: ""Regulators should evaluate every transaction on the merits; focus on the facts presented to you; determine whether or not the transaction is in the public interest. ... If not, are there conditions that can be applied ... [or] take appropriate action?""
Fox, which owns 39 percent of Britain's Sky, already has a deal for full ownership, but it has been delayed by regulatory concerns over Murdoch's influence in the U.K. Adding a complicating factor is Disney 's separate $52 billion deal to buy Fox assets, including that Sky stake.

953,Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says stronger dollar is in the best interest of the country,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , under fire for comments he made earlier this week seemingly advocating a weak dollar, told CNBC on Friday the U.S. has a long-term interest in a strong greenback.
The dollar earlier had hit a three-week low on comments Mnuchin made Wednesday that the soft greenback would be better for the United States. Since then, he and President Donald Trump have said those remarks were taken out of context. Mnuchin and Trump spoke as they attended the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""I made the comment two days ago in a press gaggle in the morning. What I said was actually very even-handed and consistent with what I said before,"" Mnuchin said Friday in an interview on CNBC's "" Squawk Box ."" He added a strong ""long-term dollar"" is in the country's best interests.
However, comments from the president and Treasury secretary did little to boost the dollar . In early trading, the currency was down about 0.4 percent against a basket of its global competitors, though it was off the lows of the session.
Mnuchin's comments were nothing terribly new from the administration. Trump himself has said in the past that he prefers a weak greenback.
For his part, the Treasury secretary repeated that he is not trying to influence the currency markets.
""Had the news printed my entire transcript the first time as opposed to just taking out one little point and kind of imply that I was trying to talk down the dollar, which I wasn't doing,"" he said. ""As a matter of fact I was very clear in my open, saying the dollar is the most liquid trading market in the world, and where the dollar is in the short term is not of concern to us, and we respect that the market sets where the dollar is.""
He added that it is not the policy of the administration to intervene in the currency markets.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists also think the markets misinterpreted Mnuchin's comments and should be focusing on what he said about the long-term dollar direction rather than the short-term market vagaries.
""Mnuchin's statements, when taken in their entirety, reaffirm the existing strong USD policy by linking dollar value to relative US economic fundamentals ... while implicitly acknowledging a more competitive and thus growth-supportive USD valuation situation vs. this time last year. Recent comments by President Trump would seem to confirm our read,"" BofAML said in a note to clients.",2018-01-26T15:49:00.000+02:00

4330,"GE books $4.2 bln charge, restates earnings as expected","General Electric said on Friday it took a $4.24 billion equity charge and reduced earnings for the last two years by 30 cents a share, figures in line with expectations the company set earlier this year when it said it would comply with new accounting standards.
The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial goods had estimated the after-tax, non-cash impact would be about $4.2 billion, plus reduced earnings for 2016 and 2017 of about 29 cents a share.
The accounting change prompted GE to recast two years of past financial statements to reflect lower income and asset values under the new standard, and those will be reflected when GE reports first-quarter results on April 20.
The value of GE's contract assets are being written down, but that does not change the value of the long-term contracts GE has, nor does it affect GE's cash flow or earnings estimates for 2018, GE said.
The adjustments appear within expectations, Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said. ""Now the focus moves to next Friday's earnings.""
The figures suggest GE executives have gotten to the bottom of some accounting issues and bolster confidence in Chief Executive Officer John Flannery after a series of financial surprises, including underestimating the impact of insurance policies that prompted a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, analysts said.
GE shares were down 1 percent at $13.35 in aftermarket trading after rising 2.4 percent on Friday.
The new accounting standard governs how companies estimate and recognize revenue from long-term contracts, and is designed to make a company's cash flow more closely match its income, accounting experts and analysts said.
The prior standard allowed companies to recognize future revenue from such agreements more quickly. The new standard shifts revenue to later in the contract duration, analysts said.
Companies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for estimating future revenue from the contracts, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts as assets on the balance sheet, experts say.
GE's contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE's regulatory filings.
GE also made adjustments for new accounting standards for pensions, cash flow and taxes on Friday.
GE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range of between $1.00 and $1.07 a share.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GE's accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern but GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.
GE said in February that it expects to make the adjustments as it switches to the new accounting standards for contracts.
GE said it chose to restate 2016 and 2017 earnings, a more exacting standard under the new rules, because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years.",2018-04-16T16:37:00.000+03:00

7362,"The dollar is surging into overbought territory, warns chart watcher. Here’s what it means","The U.S. dollar just hit its highest levels since late December, a move that's planted it in overbought territory, according to one chart watcher.
""On a very short-term basis it's getting a little ahead of itself,"" Matt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Tuesday. He noted that the dollar's relative strength index, a measure of momentum, hit 76.07 on Wednesday, surpassing the one-year peak hit in October.
""It's getting to a level, actually slightly above a level, that it reached last fall just as the dollar was starting to finish off its little bit of a rally here and then rolled back over and made new lows,"" said Maley.
The DXY U.S. dollar index tried to buck a nine-month downward trend in late September, but its short burst of gains did not last through to the end of 2017. The greenback broke higher in April after struggling for direction through the start of this year.
Unlike last year's attempt to rally, the technicals suggest gains over the past month are a little different, said Maley.
""The rally has been much stronger. It took it above its 200-day moving,"" he said. ""Also, above its trend line going all the way back to the highs in very early 2017. When you combine that with the kind of positioning we see where a lot of people are very short the dollar and very long currencies like the euro, I think that this kind of next pullback will be a little bit more shallow and could take the dollar higher.""
The dollar touched its 200-day moving average on April 27 and broke above it on May 1. The index has not traded above that key level since May 2017.
U.S. economic growth and the expectation for higher interest rates should also give the rally in the dollar more fuel, said Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global.
""We're well into the recovery at this point and, in fact, Europe has largely peaked out, Japan has peaked out,"" Sanchez told ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""However, the U.S. is continuing to expand and I think that that is very, very supportive of the expectation for higher interest rates.""
The U.S. economy grew at a 2.3 percent pace in the first quarter of this year, level with full-year economic growth in 2017. Japan's economy expanded 1.7 percent in 2017, while euro zone GDP increased 2.5 percent.
""We're actually seeing inflation come in at Fed-expected levels whereas European inflation is starting to disappoint,"" said Sanchez. ""That's also going to be supportive of a higher dollar from here.""
Higher inflation expectations in the U.S. have prompted more hawkish talk from the Federal Reserve . Markets anticipate at least two more interest rate hikes this year after an increase in March, according to CME Group fed funds futures. A fourth increase in December remains a possibility.

6824,Facebook shows once again that it does not understand or value journalism,"CNBC.com Stephen Lam | Reuters Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Facebook Inc's annual F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, May 1, 2018.
Journalism is under attack from every corner.
Donald Trump has been attacking the industry ever since he started running for president in 2015, and single-handedly popularized the term ""fake news."" On Wednesday, he was joined by Tesla CEO Elon Musk , who went on an anti-media tirade to his nearly 22 million Twitter followers, telling them that journalists are under pressure to ""get max clicks"" and that he wanted to start a new site to rate the credibility of media organizations.
But these are outright attacks, that seem designed to intimidate outlets from pursuing hard stories, and to dissuade readers from believing unfavorable coverage.
Facebook , which has has been trying to portray itself as a friend to digital publishers for the last few years, has a more insidious problem. At an institutional level, the company does not seem to understand or value journalism.
On Wednesday, the company made a video explaining how the company is fighting fake news.
In the video, a Facebook data scientist named Eduardo Ariño de la Rubia draws a chart separating internet content into four quadrants based along two axes: the horizontal axis is how accurate a piece of information is, and the vertical axis measures how intentionally misleading it is.
The point of the presentation was that Facebook is trying hard to crack down on stories in the upper-left quadrant: false information that was intended to mislead. Ariño de la Rubia labels this material as ""hoaxes.""
But before he gets to that point, he draws two squares along the lower half of the chart.
The first square, on the lower left, represents content that's wrong but not intentionally misleading. Ariño de la Rubia calls this ""being wrong on the Internet.""
The second square, on the lower right, represents content that is both correct, and not intentionally misleading. He glosses over this, calling it ""being right on the internet,"" and jokes, ""I'm sure it'll happen someday.""
In fact, there's an entire industry devoted to being accurate and not intentionally misleading. It's called journalism.
A lot of material in the upper right quadrant — high truth, but intentionally misleading — poses as journalism. Ariño de la Rubia gives examples like cherry picking statistics or propaganda, and says that Facebook has to be ""very, very careful"" here because the company's committed to free speech.
But there's actually a fairly clear line between propaganda and journalism. Propagandists have no interest in finding the truth. Their job is to convince.
Journalists don't care about convincing. Their goal is to paint the most accurate picture of the truth — including truths that powerful people and companies would rather keep hidden. They may not get it right every time, but that's the goal. There are time-tested methods for finding and fact-checking sources, and armies of editors who drive reporters crazy by forcing them to go back and check and recheck and recheck again to make sure their sources are right.
For instance, Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou wrote a series of reports in 2015 that medical tech start-up Theranos's technology did not work and that the company had systematically decieved investors. These stories were generated by a tip, and he spent months pursuing it, talking to many people in and close to the company, as he recounts in his new book "" Bad Blood. ""
Theranos tried to stop him, but it turned out that his stories were true. The company's technology didn't work. Earlier this year, the SEC charged the company's co-founders with ""massive fraud"" for deceiving investors.
That's journalism.
When Facebook equates this kind of work with ""being right on the internet,"" it shows how much respect they afford the profession.
Publishers who are depending on Facebook to throw them a lifeline should take heed. show chapters",2018-05-24T22:39:00.000+03:00
3294,JD.com's finance arm is fundraising at a $20 billion valuation,"JD.com's finance arm is fundraising at a $20 billion valuation JD.com's finance arm is looking to raise about $1.9 billion in fresh equity. The unit of China's second-largest e-commerce firm is seeking to deepen its push into areas such as securities, banking and insurance. The fundraising by JD Finance kicked off late last year and is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks Published 8 Hours Ago Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Richard Liu, founder of Chinese e-commerce player JD.com 
JD.com 's finance arm is looking to raise about 12 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) in fresh equity that could see its value double from last year to more than $20 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
The unit of China's second-largest e-commerce firm is seeking to deepen its push into areas such as securities, banking and insurance — businesses that have seen the entry of several new technology-focused players. 
The move adds to a flurry of fundraising by Chinese tech firms keen to respond to burgeoning demand for digital services, especially in the financial sector. 
The fundraising by JD Finance kicked off late last year and is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, the people said, declining to be identified as details of the deal were not public. 
Investor enthusiasm for Chinese tech stocks has jumped over the past few years. The unit was valued at about 60 billion yuan ($9.5 billion) after it was separated out from its parent in mid-2017. That valuation has since grown to about 120 billion yuan ahead of the latest fundraising, the people said. 
Potential investors in the new round include China International Capital Corp's (CICC) Qiyuan National New Industry Venture Capital Guidance Fund, grains trader COFCO and conglomerate China Merchants Group, they said. 
JD.com, CICC and China Merchants Group declined to comment. COFCO did not respond to a request for comment. 
JD Finance mainly offers online financial services and products including consumer credit and wealth management products. 
It plans to use part of the proceeds to invest in domestic financial institutions and buy licenses to operate in securities and banking as well as other areas, two of the people said. 
Currently, it only owns a few small financial licenses including a third-party payment license in China. 
Other tech heavyweights eager to expand their coffers include Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, which runs China's top online payment service Alipay. It is raising up to $5 billion at a valuation of more than $100 billion. 
Chinese search engine Baidu is also seeking new investors for its wholly owned finance unit in a deal that could fetch up to $2 billion. 
While JD Finance's valuation has jumped in a short space of time, it did not look unreasonable when compared with valuations for bigger rival Ant Financial, said one of the people. 
Two investor sources said that some investors had found JD Finance's valuations somewhat expensive and had instead opted for smaller competitors. 
In mid-2017, JD.com spun off the unit, making it a fully Chinese-owned entity, which is needed for licenses to manage certain financial products in China. 
Under the deal, it sold 28.6 percent for 14.3 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) to undisclosed investors. JD.com receives 40 percent of the restructured entity's pretax profit and has an option to convert that back to a 40 percent equity stake should the regulatory environment change.

6541,Tesla Model 3 gets Consumer Reports recommendation after braking update; shares hit session high,"Consumer Reports said Wednesday it now recommends the Tesla Model 3, reversing an earlier decision over the car's long stopping distance and other issues. The group said Tesla's ability to fix the issue with a remote software update was a first for a carmaker.
Tesla improved the car's braking distance by about 20 feet through a remote software update, placing the car within the typical stopping distance for its class, the group said. Consumer Reports had previously said the Model 3 had the longest stopping distance of any contemporary car it tested, including the much larger Ford F-150 full-size pickup.
It is not unusual for an automaker to make changes to a vehicle in response to criticism from Consumer Reports, but it is unique that Tesla was able to address this problem with an over-the-air update, Consumer Reports director of automotive testing Jake Fisher told CNBC.
""This really is an industry first,"" Fisher said.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that he appreciated the criticism, and that improvements addressing the group's other complaints are forthcoming.

Fisher had said the group would recommend the Model 3 if Tesla solved the braking issue , but in its updated review the group still had other issues with the car, such as wind noise, stiff ride, and uncomfortable rear seat. Musk told Consumer Reports that Tesla was making changes to its production line to eliminate those problems. The group will rent another car from Tesla to see if those changes make a difference.
""The change to the brakes is enough it recommend it, but it is certainly not at the top of its category and there is definitely room for improvement,"" Fisher said.
Shares of Tesla were up nearly 2 percent on the news. The stock is on pace for its third straight day of gains for the first time since Apr 5th. Shares are still 26 percent below their all-time high of $389.61, set on September 18, 2017.

2982,Cramer: Etsy is a buy after proving it can stave off Amazon,"Cramer: Etsy is a buy after proving it can stave off Amazon ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer comes around on e-commerce platform Etsy following its latest earnings report. Cramer applauds the handmade goods seller's fundamentals and recommends its stock. 20 Hours Ago | 01:06 
As technology stocks sank on Monday, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to examine a name outside the line of fire: the stock of e-commerce platform Etsy . 
Cramer was skeptical when Etsy first came public in 2015. But he changed his tune since the IPO, blessing the stock for speculation in May 2016 and recommending it again in August 2017 . 
Since last August, shares of Etsy have climbed 78 percent, and Cramer argued that the move was totally due to the company's fundamentals — a good sign for prospective investors. 
""A lot of people at one point were worried that Etsy would be steamrolled by Amazon after the retail 'Death Star' launched their own marketplace for handcrafted goods. Turns out Etsy is incredibly resilient,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said. 
""We know that because Etsy's most recent quarter was a gigantic blowout,"" he continued. ""So any chance to buy this thing into weakness is an opportunity."" 
Amazon's influence has proven to be a legitimate threat for online and brick-and-mortar retailers alike. But its push into the handmade market has not been enough to crush Etsy, which helps a network of nearly two million sellers compete in the digital retail space, Cramer said. 
Most companies that compete with Amazon fear the online giant's scale, but in this case, scale is on Etsy's side, the ""Mad Money"" host continued. 
Etsy has tens of millions of handmade goods for sale on its website; Amazon Handmade has less than one million, he noted. 
Etsy has also been improving the buyer experience with better search and recommendation functions, which translated into better holiday sales and growth across all of its core markets. 
Better yet, the company's 2017 management shakeup — in which it brought in a new chief financial officer, a new chief technology officer and a new CEO — went off without a hitch, Cramer said. 
""And boy, oh boy, can this new team deliver,"" he said. ""When Etsy reported its latest quarter last month, they knocked it out of the park."" 
Beating earnings and revenue estimates, Etsy's fourth quarter showed better-than-expected gross merchandise sellers, growth in its mobile business and a higher conversion rate, or the percentage of consumers who end up buying something after visiting Etsy's website. 
Management also gave strong full-year guidance for 2018, kick-starting a more than 30 percent run in Etsy's stock before Monday's weakness hit. 
""That is an epic run, which is why I'm so glad Etsy's finally pulling back with the rest of tech, down 1.66 percent today,"" Cramer said. ""Ideally, it goes even lower and you get even better prices. I say 'ideally' because this sell-off has nothing to do with Etsy and I believe it will bounce back with alacrity once investors calm down."" 
Cramer acknowledged that shares of Etsy look expensive, currently valued at 53 times next year's earnings estimates. But based on the company's 2021 estimates, its valuation is only 29 times earnings, a better deal for a growth stock, he said. 
""The bottom line? This was a really ugly day for the stock market, not denying it, but you need to stay calm. Approach sell-offs like this one as buying opportunities, at least when it comes to high-quality stocks of companies with great fundamentals,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. 
""Etsy's stock got hit today, but its business is in amazing shape. You have my blessing to pick some up here right now, tomorrow, even more if the pain continues, which may very well be the case given the ferocity of the Nasdaq portion of the sell-off.""

5305,USDA is looking for ways to protect farmers in trade dispute with China: Official,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is looking to find ways to shield farmers from the growing trade conflict between the United States and China , a department official said Thursday evening, without providing details of options under review.

CNBC.com Bettman Collection | Getty Images 
Market fear hasn't been this high in more than a year, according to a poll of retail investors that came out before Thursday' big rally. 
Bearishness on the weekly American Association of Individual Investors survey hit 42.8 percent in the most recent reading. That's come amid a year of wild fluctuations brought on by worries of trade wars, inflation and a wild political backdrop. 
The pessimism level was last higher on March 9, 2017. 
As expected, the bulls also were in full retreat, with just 26.1 percent of respondents saying they're expecting the market to be higher in six months. That was the lowest reading since Aug. 31, 2016 and represented a drop of 5.8 percentage points. The rise in bearishness was 6.1 percentage points. 
Both readings were at ""unusual"" levels in their respective directions and consistent with turns in the market, according to Charles Rotblut, AAII Journal editor. In other words, a high level of bearishness often signals that the market is ready to move higher.

2156,"This $1,499 floating tent lets you camp on the water","CNBC.com show chapters 1 Hour Ago | 01:11 
Sometimes a new twist on a classic product makes it revolutionary enough to capture the imagination of the masses. Ethan Smith, founder of the outdoor apparel retailer SmithFly, has found that his invention, an inflatable floating tent that lets campers wake up on the water, is doing just that. 
Videos featuring SmithFly's Shoal Tent , which costs $1,499, have racked up well over 20 million combined views on Facebook. Sales are triple the estimates Smith laid out when he launched the product in October 2017, though, citing a potential deal with outside investors, Smith declines to provide total sales figures. 
""I just figured I'd throw it out there and if there were a couple people that were interested I'd sell a few of them,"" he tells CNBC Make It . ""And it took off right away. I mean, as soon as we got it posted, it kind of went viral and it went crazy."" 
For now, Smith says, customers ordering one of his tents can expect about a six-week wait as he works with a manufacturer in China to keep up with demand. SmithFly | A SmithFly Shoal Tent can make camping on the water possible and can hold 1,200 pounds. 
The tent inflates with a provided air pump and features a tear-away top and a drop-stitch floor that allows for inflation more reminiscent of an air mattress than a raft. The inflatable floor can support up to 1,200 pounds by itself, Smith says, and is supported by redundant air chambers in the underlying raft to prevent accidental sinking. 
Originally focused solely on fly-fishing gear, SmithFly, based in Troy, Ohio, has slowly expanded its product focus to include other outdoor goods. First it debuted an inflatable stand-up paddle board and then a raft outfitted to make fishing more comfortable. 
When Smith thought about venturing into offering tents using his same Chinese manufacturer, a friend who owned a canoe livery that had frequently run out of campsites offered a suggestion. ""If you put a raft under that and combine the tent with the raft, we might have something really cool and we can rent it out on the river,"" he told Smith. 
After a few modifications to include a detachable tent topper, the Shoal Tent was born. 
The early success of the tent is welcome news for the company Smith launched in 2011, when the recession caused the marketing team he was working on at a large branding firm to shrink from 12 employees to just three. At the time, his wife feared he'd be next. 
""Every week when I'd come home and they'd have layoffs, my wife would say, 'Well, when are you going to get laid off?'"" he recalls. ""I had this idea for this fly-fishing stuff and she said, 'Why don't you start that and then if you get laid off you can work on that.'"" 
After self-funding his fly-fishing side hustle with a roughly $10,000 loan from his bank, Smith started creating customized vests and fly-fishing gear. Then he ventured into inflatables. Ethan Smith | Ethan Smith started his outdoor apparel side hustle when he thought he was next to be fired from the marketing company he worked for. 
The reactions to the tent on social media quickly made it apparent that demand was going to outstrip supply. Smith was forced to air-ship the tents over from China at a much higher cost, and even so he still couldn't fulfill orders on time. New customers have had to join a wait-list since the tents began shipping in early February. 
Now, Smith figures the product he took a gamble on could dwarf everything else his company does by a factor of 10 in just a year or two — provided, of course, that he can stay ahead of the competition. Knockoffs are already popping up, which is a common hazard in e-commerce . 
While SmithFly doesn't have a patent on the tent, Smith believes he can market it as the first of its kind and implement planned innovations, too.

The grocery delivery landscape just got a lot more interesting.
Sam's Club, a division of Walmart , is partnering with Instacart to offer same-day delivery. It adds yet another major grocer to Instacart's arsenal as it prepares to compete against Amazon and Whole Foods.
In a joint press release, Instacart and Sam's Club says they'll roll out the service in three markets to start: Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and St. Louis, Missouri.
The new partnership raises questions about the future of Walmart's grocery delivery business and whether it might one day partner with Instacart at large.
Walmart increasingly competes with Amazon in the ecommerce and grocery space and has been building its own delivery system with partners like Uber and Google. But investors punished Walmart after its latest quarter showed slowing ecommerce sales. Shares saw their biggest one-day drop since 1988 on the news.
In a note to clients after the earnings disappointment, Credit Suisse wrote that the retailer could redeem itself through a golden opportunity in online groceries.
As Sam's Club tests the waters with Instacart, investors are likely look at whether the grocery delivery startup could help Walmart lift ecommerce sales by giving it access to numerous markets at once.
Sachin Padwal, Sam's Club's VP of Omnichannel and In-Club Product says in the press release, ""Instacart is a trusted partner by so many customers, we are thrilled to be launching this service with them.""
Instacart is increasingly being seen as big chain grocers' answer to the Amazon/Whole Foods threat and retail giants like Walmart that are pushing into grocery delivery.
After Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Instacart expanded partnerships with Costco and CVS and signed new deals with Albertsons and Krogers.

1167,A crucial German vote this Sunday is seen as the key near-term driver for euro/dollar,"A crucial vote in Germany on Sunday has the potential to derail stability in Europe and send the euro tumbling.
The continent's largest economy has been without a formal government for four months with long-term chancellor Angela Merkel unable to secure a ruling coalition.
Last week, there appeared to be a breakthrough when it was announced that the hierarchy of the center-left Social Democrat Party (SPD) had agreed to a preliminary ""grand coalition"" with Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
In Bonn on Sunday, the SPD will ask its 600 delegates whether the party should begin full coalition talks. If that passes, the next step would be a postal vote for the SPD's 450,000 members.
The party's former leader, Sigmar Gabriel, who now acts as Germany's foreign minister, reportedly said last week that many around the world want a deal to be struck.
""It is no exaggeration. This coming Sunday it is not only Europe that is looking spellbound at the SPD party conference, but many people far further afield. The world will be watching Bonn on Sunday,"" he said.
The euro has enjoyed a stellar run of late, rising almost 4 percent versus the dollar over the last three months. It currently sits at around $1.22, marking a three-year high.
That run, while aided in no small part by dollar weakness, has been seen as a reflection of thumping euro zone data and relative stability among EU members.
Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and EM Research at Commerzbank, said Friday that Sunday's decision has the potential to move the euro in either direction.
""Rejection threatens to lead to either a minority government in Berlin or to new elections. Both are not good for the euro simply because they would create uncertainty,"" he said via email.
""More importantly, however, the GroKo (grand coalition) would probably be euro-positive because this constellation could represent the greatest degree of Germany's support for the French president's European initiative among all conceivable political constellations in Berlin.""
Leuchtmann said he could not forecast a result but that SPD delegates are normally ""well-behaved party soldiers"" who follow the leadership.
In a note Thursday, Morgan Stanley's European FX team wrote that Sunday's vote is the ""key potential near-term risk"" for unwinding the recent upward run for the euro.
It said a rejection of the deal could see the euro slip back down towards $1.17. Assuming a vote to pursue coalition talks is achieved, Morgan Stanley calls upside resistance at $1.23.
Sean Gallup | Getty Images Martin Schulz, leader of Germany's SPD party Martin Schulz, SPD leader and former European parliament president, has been traversing Germany in recent days to shore up support among party delegates.
His prospects of securing an SPD vote suffered a setback Tuesday when the party's Berlin branch voted to reject the talks and called on other delegates to reject any deal with Merkel.
A major split over a coalition also exists within the Social Democrats between its elders in the leadership and the party's youth wing.
The Jusos (young socialists) have pushed the slogan ""NoGroKo,"" arguing that forming another coalition with Merkel's center-right CDU would be a sell-out of the party's values.
The head of Jusos is a 28-year-old politics student called Kevin Kuhnert, whose rising popularity is seen as a real threat to Merkel's ambition to rule again.
He wants the SPD to break free of its cooperation with the CDU or the party's future will be put at risk.
""The renewal of the SPD will happen outside a grand coalition or it won't happen at all,"" he said",2018-01-19T16:58:00.000+02:00

5588,UPDATE 1-White House seeks to speed reviews of major infrastructure projects,"UPDATE 1-White House seeks to speed reviews of major infrastructure projects David Shepardson Reuters 
(Updates with memorandum signed, adds reaction from environmental group, Republican member of Congress) 
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - The Trump administration announced on Monday a new effort to speed environmental reviews for major infrastructure projects, a White House official said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has made shortening the often lengthy timetable to get approvals for new highways, runways and other projects a key focus of his infrastructure reform plans. 
Trump presided over the signing of the ""One Federal Decision"" memorandum of understanding by members of his cabinet after a meeting with agency heads. 
The signers include the heads of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Homeland Security departments, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. 
The memorandum says ""one lead federal agency will be responsible for navigating major infrastructure projects through the entire Federal environmental review and permitting process."" 
The agencies will work to develop a single environmental Impact Statement and sign a single record of decision and the lead agency will seek written agreement from other agencies at key points. It also seeks to try to quickly resolve interagency disputes. 
Representative Bill Shuster, who heads the House Transportation Committee, called the move allowed under a 2015 law a ""positive step forward in the fight against inefficient, bureaucratic permitting."" 
Scott Slesinger, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said local residents should have input in major projects and downplayed the memorandum. 
""Trumps much ballyhooed infrastructure plan has been diminished to little more than an ideological attack on environmental safeguards,"" Slesinger said. 
In August, Trump signed an executive order directing that agencies use the process for major infrastructure projects. 
Trump has vowed to end ""the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build. 
The Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting. ""It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes,"" Trump said last year. 
In February, Trump unveiled a long-awaited infrastructure plan designed to encourage spending on improvements by states, localities and private investors, but it faces an uncertain fate in Congress. 
Trump asked Congress to authorize $200 billion over 10 years to spur a projected $1.5 trillion in road, bridge and other projects. 
The proposal has come under fire from Democrats who said it would put a huge burden on local governments without providing enough federal dollars. 
Trump's proposal also seeks legislative approval to sweep away environmental and other regulatory hurdles to new projects. 
Trump's top infrastructure adviser D.J. Gribbin is expected to depart the White House later this week, an administration official said Monday. The administration is considering a number of potential candidates to replace him. (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2018-04-09T21:10:00.000+03:00
2938,Mueller builds a case against Russians who leaked Democrat emails during the 2016 election,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is building a case against the Russians who hacked and leaked private information of several key Democrats during the 2016 election, NBC News reported.
These new charges rely heavily on intelligence gathered by the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and target a different group of Russian actors than those indicted last month, according to NBC.
A possible new indictment would include details on the Russian intelligence operation that released emails stolen from both the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, NBC reported. Democratic emails made public through website Wikileaks factored heavily in the 2016 election, embarrassing Democrats and adding fuel to the Trump campaign.
Sources told NBC News that Mueller has long had sufficient evidence to make a case, but has been waiting for a strategic moment.
Mueller's team has reportedly asked witnesses whether Trump was aware that the emails he repeatedly referenced throughout his campaign had been stolen and whether he was involved in their release, according to NBC News.
President Trump has repeatedly denied collusion with Russian intelligence actors.

* Wheat rises recovers from Mondays 10-day low 
* Soybeans, corn up on buying interest after falls 
* Risk not over for drought-hit U.S. winter crops

(Recasts with European trade, adds quotes, changes dateline) HAMBURG, April 17 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose on Tuesday on bargain-buying after falling 2 percent in the previous session, with the market shrugging off a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report saying the state of U.S. winter wheat is improving. ""Wheat, corn and soybeans are seeing a bounce today on buying interest after sharp falls in some sectors on Monday, said Charles Clack, agricultural commodity analyst at Rabobank. Chicago Board of Trade May wheat rose 0.7 percent to $4.65-1/2 a bushel at 1122 GMT. May soybeans increased 0.2 percent to $10.44-3/4 a bushel and May corn rose 0.3 percent to $3.84 a bushel. Wheat saw a large drop on Monday on forecasts for much-needed rain in the U.S. Plains which took a fair level of risk out of the market, Clack said. This could be viewed as presenting a good buying opportunity today with some regarding the market as oversold. Although U.S. crop conditions are showing an improvement, there is still a long time to go in the season and the risk to the U.S. crop is far from over yet. The winter in the U.S. was dry so there remains the question whether crop abandonment will creep up. The USDA said late on Monday that 31 percent of the U.S. wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, up from 30 percent last week and surpassing market expectations of 30 percent. Corn was following wheat on Monday and is also seeing some influence from wheat today, Clack said. There is also some worry about the slow start to U.S. corn sowings which is supportive, with 3 percent planted against 6 percent this time last year. ""U.S. farmers are starting to get behind with corn plantings and weather forecasts are not favorable for sowings. The U.S. planting delays are not a huge concern but it is a factor which could start to play on peoples minds. Soybeans were supported by renewed signs of trade friction as China announced new measures aimed at imports of the feed grain sorghum from the U.S. 
U.S. oilseed processors crushed a record volume of soybeans in March, the U.S. National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) said on Monday. There is again focus in the soybean market on bullish factors after falls on Monday,"" Clack said. ""The U.S./China trade war is again in view, Argentinas crop is poor and high U.S. crushing figures underline strong demand.

3140,Tillerson will give up secretary of State duties at the end of the day,"Outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will give up his duties at the end of Tuesday and officially leave the job at the end of the month.
President Donald Trump fired Tillerson earlier in the day in a tweet, and Tillerson told reporters he spoke to the president Tuesday afternoon. Speaking at the State Department, the top American diplomat said he will focus on an orderly transition for Trump's new choice to lead the State Department, CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Tillerson will hand his responsibilities over to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.
Without thanking Trump or mentioning him by name, the outgoing Cabinet secretary expressed appreciation for ""selfless leaders"" at the State Department and other agencies, his voice breaking at times. He highlighted what he deemed the strides made during his time at the agency, and encouraged his deputies to stay in their current jobs.
""What is most important is to ensure an orderly and smooth transition during a time that the country continues to face significant policy and national security challenges,"" Tillerson said.
Leah Millis | Reuters U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks to the media at the U.S. State Department after being fired by President Donald Trump in Washington, March 13, 2018. The former Exxon Mobil CEO's departure caps more than a year of policy clashes, sometimes public, with his boss. The State Department has lost clout in the Trump administration, and the White House has proposed massive budget cuts for the agency. Morale in the department reportedly dropped under Tillerson's watch.
White House officials told news outlets that Tillerson found out he was fired on Friday. State Department spokesman Steve Goldstein issued a statement saying Tillerson had not planned to leave. He ""did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason"" for his firing, Goldstein said.
Goldstein himself was fired Tuesday, as well.
The secretary of State and president publicly disagreed several times during Tillerson's tenure. Those areas include the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate agreement, negotiations with North Korea and the response to Russia's actions around the globe.
Most recently, Tillerson diverged from the White House this week in saying poison used on a former spy in the United Kingdom ""came from Russia."" He took another shot at Moscow in his parting remarks Tuesday.
""Much work remains to respond to the troubling behavior and actions on the part of the Russian government,"" he said. ""Russia must assess carefully as to how its actions are in the best interests of the Russian people and of the world more broadly. Continuing on their current trajectory is likely to lead to greater isolation on their part, a situation which is not in anyone's interest.""
In thanking State Department officials for their work, Tillerson highlighted what he deemed progress made in the past year. He said the U.S. ""exceeded the expectations of almost everyone"" in applying sanctions in an effort to stop North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
He added that ""much remains to be done"" in U.S. foreign policy, pointing to efforts to end a civil war in Syria and ensure stability in Iraq. He said the U.S. would face a challenge in improving its relationship with China, ""free of conflict.""
In closing his remarks, Tillerson again thanked the State Department and Americans as a whole for ""acts of kindness"" and ""quiet hard work.""
Said Tillerson: ""I'll now return to private life as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I've had to serve my country. God bless all of you, God bless the American people, God bless America.""

143,NFL players' surprising new performance hack—going vegan,"The Tennessee Titans play the Jacksonville Jaguars in December 2014. SHARES 
When you think of what NFL players eat , you might imagine hulking athletes tearing into juicy steaks and scarfing fattening food. Perhaps it's not so far from the truth: ESPN recently reported it takes nearly 600 pounds of beef to feed the Buffalo Bills for a week, and that's not even counting chicken (700 pounds) and fish. 
And who can forget that hot dog-and-Cheetos dinner Jacksonville Jaguars' Jalen Ramsey once tweeted? Tweet 
However, for an increasing number of players, that's changing. With quarterback Tom Brady headed to his eighth Super Bowl with the New England Patriots on Sunday, others in the league have taken notice of his healthy habits. As the Boston Globe points out : ""It's a movement being led by Tom Brady, who dominated the league in his late 30s and is still going strong at 40, thanks to his vegetable-based diet and flexibility training over muscle mass."" Getty Images | Kevin C. Cox Tom Brady 
And now, there's a new performance hack taking hold in the NFL — going vegan. Brady himself teamed up with vegan meal delivery service Purple Carrot to create a meatless, dairy-free TB12 performance meal plan in 2016. (Though not vegan, his personal diet is reportedly 80 percent plant-based .) And this season, the Tennessee Titans had a reported 11 team members go vegan (""with varying levels of commitment,"" according to ESPN ). The team made it all the way to the playoffs for the first time in a decade, reports SI.com . 
Linebacker Derrick Morgan went vegan nearly a year ago. Defensive tackle Jurrell Casey and defensive lineman DaQuan Jones took the leap too. But linebacker Wesley Woodyard needed a little more convincing. 
""Y'all crazy with this vegan thing,"" was Woodyard's initial reaction, reports ESPN . ""I'm from LaGrange, Georgia. I'm going to eat my pork."" 
But soon he was convinced, and better for it. ""My energy level's gone up,"" Woodyard, recently told the Associated Press . ""And it's just putting in good fuel to your body. And of course, it's always hard to keep weight on [during the season]. But it's worth it for me staying on top of my health."" 
The Titans players are convinced a plant-based diet ""helps them lose weight, recover faster and, believe it or not, play better,"" according to ESPN . 
Other professional athletes have made the switch to vegan or vegetarian diets in the past year or so, too. The list includes NBA stars Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, Wilson Chandler, Al Jefferson, Garrett Temple, Enes Kanter JaVale McGee and Jahlil Okafor, according to Bleacher Report . 
Veganism has also been championed for years by tennis player Venus Williams and snowboarder Hannah Teter . The 300-pound vegan 
In the NFL, former lineman David Carter was one of the first to go vegan in 2014 while he was still playing. Now, he's an advocate for plant-based diets, going by the nickname, The 300 lb. Vegan . Carter, 30, says the reason for his switch in diet stemmed from health concerns. 
""I was young, 22, 23, dealing with old-man illnesses at a really young age,"" Carter tells CNBC Make It . ""I was playing a professional sport where you're supposed to be touted as one of the strongest guys, the world's top athletes and all this, but [I was] taking high blood pressure medication...painkillers, anti-inflammatories....a long list."" 
Carter was also struggling with painful tendinitis. 
""It was hard for me to do bench press, it was hard for me to do push-ups,"" Carter says. ""Even lifting my body out of the bathtub, it felt like someone was taking a knife to my elbows and twisting that knife around and it was excruciating pain."" 
The athlete was inspired to switch his diet after seeing the documentary, ""Forks Over Knives,"" which ""examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled or even reversed, by rejecting animal-based and processed-foods,"" according to its website . 
""I was drinking a milkshake while I was watching the documentary and poured it out,"" Carter tells SI.com . 
The film touched on the idea that body inflammation is linked to the consumption of animal products, and Carter says it ""completely changed"" how he thought about eating. 
But even if you're not an athlete or dealing with disease, Carter says going vegan can help with ""just overall discomfort from eating unhealthy foods and the effect that has on your body,"" he says. ""[I]t's just a lot easier for you to function during work because your body is functioning better."" How veganism can boost productivity 
Carter may be right. A study published in 2015 in the American Journal of Health Promotion found that a plant-based diet can boost physical health and emotional well-being, and revealed that an 18-week dietary intervention program boosted employee productivity. 
In the study, researchers with the non-profit Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine placed GEICO employees that had a BMI of 25 or above, or had been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, on a low-fat, glycemic, high-fiber vegan diet. 
The study found that participants experienced a boost in overall productivity and measurable improvements in anxiety, depression, fatigue and general health, based on their responses to a questionnaire. They opted for carbohydrate-rich foods like brown rice, steel cut oats and rye bread, which the study notes helps regulate serotonin levels in the brain. 
""Depression is related to inflammation in the body and low levels of serotonin,"" one of the researchers of the study, Dr. Ulka Agarwal, writes in a blog post . ""Plant-based foods naturally lower inflammation in the body because they are naturally low in fat and high in antioxidants. High vegetable intake increases the amount of B vitamins in the diet, which have been found to affect mood."" 
A similar study by the same author, Neal Barnard, published in the Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism in 2010, also linked work productivity to veganism, revealing similar results . The study found that a worksite vegan nutrition program can improve health-related quality of life and work productivity. Harnessing the power of a plant-based diet 
If the idea of a strict vegan diet feels overwhelming, start small. 
Meatless Mondays have become increasingly popular. Some New York City schools have even implemented Meatless Monday initiatives, offering all-veggie menus on the first day of the school week. 
Restaurant chain TGI Friday's has also hopped on the plant-based bandwagon, and recently launched a new partnership with the Meatless Mondays campaign to promote its new vegan entree, Beyond Burger. 
""Our research shows that choosing meatless options, even one day a week, can help make a difference in our personal health and the health of our planet,"" says Dana Smith, Meatless Monday campaign director. TWEET 
Karina Inkster, a vegan fitness and nutrition coach who has been vegan for 15 years, also recommends changing your diet in stages, starting with a shift in mindset. Focus on the over 350 vegan foods you are able to eat, instead of focusing on what you're cutting out. 
""It works way better to think about the abundance of food you can eat,"" Inkster tells CNBC Make It. ""How many plant-based foods can you cram into your diet? Which then automatically crowds out the animal products, versus thinking about what you can't eat anymore."" 
Another trick? 
""Veganize your meals by time of day,"" Inkster explains. ""So start just by veganizing your breakfast. What can you have instead of eggs? A tofu scramble that still has protein in it."" If that doesn't sound appetizing, ""maybe oatmeal with nuts and seeds and fruit on it."" 
Then, Inkster recommends moving on to packing vegan lunches for work and having vegan snacks available. Finally, try tackling dinner, which Inkster notes often takes the most work for people. 
""Generally people want to create new habits as they go along,"" Inkster says. ",2018-01-31T18:19:00.000+02:00
7303,Morgan Stanley says we're in a bear market but investors just don't realize it yet,"Venture Capital Morgan Stanley says we're in a bear market but investors just don't realize it yet ""I think we're in a rolling bear market,"" said Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist. ""It's fooling everybody at the index level, but there's a lot of pain out there."" The strategist's comment came as the S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average slipped nearly 1.2 percent. The most bearish strategist tracked by CNBC, Wilson has consistently forecasted that the S&P 500 will finish the year at 2,750, implying less than 1 percent upside for the rest of the year. CNBC.com Getty Images
Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist believes the stock market is in the midst of a cyclical bear market that could last through the end of next year.
""I think we're in a rolling bear market. Every sector has gone down at least 11 or 12 percent at least once this year. Some were down 18, 19, 20 percent,"" Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, said on CNBC's "" Halftime Report "" on Thursday. ""It's fooling everybody at the index level, but there's a lot of pain out there: Staples, homebuilders, some of these semiconductor stocks that are more cyclical are having problems.""
The strategist's comment came as the major market indexes added to their weekly losses, with the S&P 500 down 0.3 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average down nearly 1.2 percent since Tuesday. Markets were closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
But while stocks were poised for a positive return for the month of May, volatility has plagued markets since the beginning of the year, with the Dow and S&P 500 both falling more than 10 percent from their highs at one point. In turn, the bumpy trading has signaled to many market gurus that aged bull market could finally be taking a breather.
While stocks remain above their lows notched earlier this year, Wilson explained his definition of a bear market varies from traditional Wall Street wisdom.
""A bear market to me doesn't [necessarily] mean the market has to go down 20 percent,"" he said. ""A bear market is a tougher environment, it's hard to make money. Volatility is a lot higher, so I don't care what kind of portfolio you're running, you can't run as much risk anymore, you just can't do it.""
The most bearish strategist tracked by CNBC , Wilson has consistently forecasted that the S&P 500 will finish the year at 2,750, implying less than 1 percent upside for the broad market index over the remaining seven months. But the sluggish returns aren't likely to abate anytime soon, Wilson warned, telling CNBC that the cyclical bear market ""could last through the end of 2019.""
Many of Wilson's comments Thursday echoed Morgan Stanley analysis earlier this month, when the bank told clients in a note that the ""end of easy"" investing was over.
""We think it's pretty obvious that the market had discounted the news on tax cuts, global growth and still supportive financial conditions,"" Wilson wrote. ""In many ways a correction or consolidation was overdue and makes perfect sense. The question is whether or not this turns into something more sinister.""
Chief among Morgan Stanley worries have been a return of inflation, uncertain political outlook and tightening monetary policy, the lack of which helped fuel the unprecedented run in the U.S. stock market over the past nine years.

3577,Why the massive gun control march on Washington should scare both the GOP and Democrats,"Attendance at Saturday's ""March for Our Lives"" rally in Washington, DC is expected to draw up to 500,000 people – which could make it one of the largest protest s in US history. The demonstration will mark the second big splash in as many weeks made by a group of teenage activists who are clamoring for a more sensible approach to gun violence.
Last week, an estimated one million students across the US took seventeen minutes out of their day - one minute for each the lives lost in the Parkland, Florida massacre - as part of the National School Walkout .
The massive support the movement is generating has made some elected officials take notice, even prompting Florida's Republican Governor Rick Scott to break with the NRA (National Rifle Association) and sign into law a bill that approved a three-day waiting period for the purchase of all firearms while raising the legal age required to buy a gun from 18 to 21 – both changes vehemently opposed by the NRA.
How does a movement get so big so quickly? After all, the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School happened just over a month ago. How does a group of teenagers – most of them not even old enough to vote – galvanize an offensive that actually forces a change in the law dealing with one of America's most intractable and divisive political issues?
Misreading the tea leaves Analysts who say that all this is a sign that the gun debate has reached a ""tipping point"" are misreading the tea leaves. The underpinnings of the ""March for Our Lives"" movement isn't about really about guns, nor is it about school safety; it's all about Generation Z and its ability and willingness to leverage the power of its voice to effectuate sweeping changes across society at an accelerated pace.
Although the exact birth years may vary slightly, most demographers define Generation Z as the cohort born between 1995 and 2012. Worldwide, they are over two billion strong and here in the US, they are the largest generation , comprising over 26% of the population.
Generation Z (named so because they came after 'Generation Y', which was later rebranded as 'the Millennials') grew up in the aftermath of 9/11, lived through the global financial recession of 2008, and has never known a world without the internet. In terms of politics, unlike older generations who have witnessed politicians working across the aisle and collaborating on the biggest social issues of the day, this generation has never known anything but gridlock in Washington and increasingly polarized partisan politics.
Generation Z finds its voice To understand Saturday's march in the nation's capital in the context of this generation, I reached out to father-son duo and generational experts David and Jonah Stillman, arguably the nation's foremost authorities on Generation Z, and authors of GenZ@Work .
""We are a generation perfectly positioned to make change happen on any number of social and economic issues,"" says Jonah Stillman, himself a recent high school graduate who now consults on Generation Z related topics for the National Football League as well as for global brands such as 3M and the business networking site LinkedIn.
""Yes, I think our generation will make a big footprint on the gun issue this Saturday where perhaps other generations have struggled; but, it could have just as well been gay rights, racism, or any number of other pressing issues. Don't think of us as the generation obsessed with gun control – we are the generation obsessed with making tangible change. We aren't content to sit on the sidelines, engaging in endless debate; we are a generation of action, and this is just the beginning.""
Politicians should take note It would behoove politicians from both major parties to take note.
David Schultz, a professor of political science at Minnesota's Hamline University and the author of, American Politics in the Age of Ignorance , echoed Stillman's assessment of Generation Z.
""This is the 'Do-It-Yourself Generation,'"" says Schultz who has studied and written about the impacts of generational politics in America. ""All of our research indicates that Generation Z will be much more active in exacting change with or without the help of the political establishment. This Saturday's march has the gun control debate in its crosshairs, representing a coming of political age for Generation Z. But a year from now, it could be healthcare, the environment, or any number of other issues.""
According to a recent survey commissioned by Northeastern University, only 3% of GenZers view political leaders as role models. And although less than a third of these estimated 78 million Americans will be old enough to vote in this year's midterms, a politically engaged generation that has little to no tolerance for the semantically empty "" thoughts and prayers "" refrain has the potential to upend the traditional political establishment.
As Americans tune into live coverage of Saturday's expansive march on Washington, they should be mindful of what they are really watching: the awakening of an entirely new generation of voices - a generation that is just beginning to flex its political muscle. Generation Zers will expect their leaders to bring about change at a pace more in line with those who grew up in an all-digital environment, and one that will certainly challenge the pace of change as rendered by the Washington establishment.
The clash between Generation Z and Washington politicians is a drama that will unfold over the next several election cycles, with the narrative arc focusing on how long it takes the nation's major parties to respond to the demands of an emerging political class which will be supplying a fresh batch of several million new voters to the electorate every year between now and 2030. The first chapter in this epic saga begins this Saturday.

4946,Democratic congressman on Syria: 'We cannot let chemical attacks go unanswered',"House Armed Services Committee member John Garamendi said Monday that a U.S. response in Syria was needed, but the way President Donald Trump carried it out had ""no legality.""
""We cannot let chemical attacks go without an answer, and certainly this was an answer,"" the California Democrat told CNBC's "" Squawk Box ,"" referring to the weekend U.S., British and French airstrikes on Syria.
Garamendi said he's introducing legislation that would block any U.S. military actions in Syria without congressional approval.
""It's an answer for which there is no legality. This is an attack on a foreign country, an act of war, and therefore Congress has to declare war or authorization to use military force,"" he said.
Trump ordered targeted military action in Syria late Friday, following an alleged chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar Assad that killed at least 60 people.
In a later briefing from the Pentagon, Defense Secretary James Mattis said the president ordered the strikes to destroy Syria's chemical weapons development infrastructure, and the U.S. response was a legitimate and proportionate response to Assad's continued use of unconventional warfare.
Garamendi, who was briefed on the apparent chemical attack in Syria by Mattis, said the administration needs to form a strategy to ensure something like the chemical weapons attack doesn't happen again.
""What we have to have here is a coherent strategy based upon a set of objects, hopefully dealing with a reduction in the violence, dealing with the refugees and dealing with the fact that Assad is likely to be there for some time to come,"" he said.
Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, told CNBC a military response was the right signalm but now, the question for Trump is to figure out how he's going to make a difference.
""This is an inflection point in which we did respond to a chemical attack. So, it's a moment to assess how we move forward,"" said Crocker, who served as Syria ambassador in Bill Clinton 's administration. He also served in roles for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama .
Crocker said the U.S. needs to realize Assad will likely not be leaving anytime soon. ""It's good to reflect. We're about 100 years into the new Middle East,"" he said.
The U.S. is expected to announce Monday more sanctions on Russia because of its support for Assad.

2782,What to expect from 'Sen. Mitt Romney' in the Trump era,"CNBC.com George Frey | Getty Images Former Massachusetts Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is interviewed at the Silicon Slopes Tech Conference on January 19, 2018 in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
A Sen. Mitt Romney would bring the clout to rebuke President Donald Trump 's most erratic behavior and some of his policies. 
Just don't expect him to disagree with Republican Party too much if he wins Utah's Senate election in November. 
On Thursday, the former Massachusetts governor is set to announce his plan to run for the seat vacated by Sen. Orrin Hatch , who is retiring. Romney, a Mormon who is popular in Utah, has a strong chance of becoming a senator. 
The 2012 GOP presidential nominee would boast a national profile rarely seen from a first-term senator. The conservative Romney would likely agree with Trump on most issues, such as the GOP tax law passed late last year. Policies over which he could clash with Trump include national security, relations with Russia and immigration. 
The frequent Trump critic could also use his influence to criticize the president's divisive statements or work on bipartisan deals, according to two former Romney aides. But Romney would likely have to hold back some criticism of Trump, said Kevin Madden, who was a spokesman for Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. 
Trump remains highly popular among Republicans and Romney would be only one voice among 100 senators. 
""People are going to have to manage expectations about Romney serving as the premier or main counterbalance to Trump inside the party. A lot of people think that's going to happen automatically,"" said Madden, a partner at public affairs consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies. 
Ryan Williams, another spokesman for Romney's 2012 campaign, added: ""He's not going to be a daily critic of the president. But when there's something that rises to the level of where he feels the need to speak out, he'll do it."" 
Romney would likely have a different relationship with the president than the outgoing Hatch, who has praised Trump in recent months. After the tax plan's passage in December, the senator called Trump ""one heck of a leader."" Trump reportedly begged the 83-year old Hatch to run for re-election one more time. 
CNBC could not immediately reach Romney for comment. Romney's policies 
While Romney's positions could have shifted over the years, his 2012 campaign provides a guide to the stances he could take in Congress. Romney's policy positions could differ as he tries to appeal to a Utah electorate, rather than voters nationwide. 
Madden notes that he would have to focus on some Utah-specific issues such as land use and the biotechnology sector, among others. 
In 2012, Romney adhered to fiscal conservatives' beliefs on the economy. He pledged to cut government spending and warned about the dangers of adding to the national debt. The Trump administration and current GOP-controlled Congress appear to have abandoned those tenets. They are expected to contribute to the growing debt with their recently passed tax plan , which they followed up with a deal on massive spending increases this month . 
Romney pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act and push back against its provisions that critics say infringe on religious freedom. While some consider the health-care plan Romney implemented in Massachusetts a precursor to Obamacare, Romney called for states to craft their own health-care plans. Some current GOP lawmakers have pushed for similar health policy . 
The former governor could break with Trump in two notable areas. In 2012, Romney famously called Russia the biggest geopolitical foe the United States faces. 
Since Trump became president, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have argued he has not responded forcefully enough to Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Romney could become another one of those members of Congress. 
And though the 2012 GOP presidential nominee pushed for increased border security and a fence on the southern border — an area where he agrees with Trump and many other Republicans — he also championed lower barriers to legal entry for highly skilled immigrants and stressed the importance of keeping families together. Trump is currently pushing for major restrictions on legal immigration and limits on extended family reunification . 
It is unclear where Romney would stand now on the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Trump ended the program in September with a six-month delay, and Congress is scrambling to find a solution to shield the immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Romney's influence and relationship with Trump 
Romney would start his first six-year term with more influence than most senators. In one sign of his clout, an Atlantic report earlier this month said the GOP was already considering him to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee . In that role, he would oversee the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans and help to vet potential candidates. 
Regardless of whether he gets a leadership position, Romney would have a big platform to speak out against Trump. He has the name recognition to start a national discussion or advance it. 
Romney has been a frequent critic of the president in the past. 
In March 2016, Romney eviscerated then-candidate Trump in a speech. He warned that Trump's economic policies could ""instigate a trade war"" and ""balloon the deficit and national debt."" He called Trump a ""phony"" and a ""fraud"" and warned that his national security policy would make Americans less safe. 
Romney changed his tune after Trump's election. The president-elect interviewed him more than once to possibly serve as secretary of State. In November 2016, Romney praised Trump's ""impressive"" transition effort and noted how hard it is to win the presidency. 
As he narrowed down the candidates to serve as America's top diplomat, Trump denied that he included Romney in the process to torment him after the harsh criticism during the campaign. 
""It's not about revenge,"" the president-elect said in December 2016. 
Trump later chose Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department. 
Since the secretary of State interview process ended, Romney has occasionally used social media to rebuke the president. Trump supported Roy Moore — a man accused of sexually abusing teens decades ago — in last year's Alabama Senate special election. In December, Romney tweeted that he believed Moore accuser Leigh Corfman and said electing Moore ""would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation."" 
When Trump reportedly questioned last month why the U.S. needed immigrants from ""s---hole"" African countries, Romney called the sentiment ""antithetical to American values."" 
As the 83-year-old Hatch mulled retirement in December, Trump reportedly urged him to seek re-election in part to avoid a Romney run for office. When Hatch announced his retirement in January, Trump and Romney spoke on the phone. The president wished the former governor good luck in his future endeavors. 
Despite the public clashes, Williams believes Romney wants to work with Trump and would not run as an anti-Trump candidate. 
""He's a conservative Republican, but he won't hesitate to speak out if he disagrees with President Trump,"" he said. 
Both former Romney aides consider taxes and some other economic policies areas in which Romney and Trump could cooperate. They believe Romney would have supported the GOP tax law, which permanently chopped rates for companies and at least temporarily trimmed the tax burden on most individuals.",2018-02-14T22:23:00.000+02:00

1819,These tropical countries are taking part in the Winter Olympics for the first time,"A year-round balmy climate is hardly conducive for skiing and ice-skating, but tropical countries are now making their presence felt in winter games.
Taking part for the first time ever in the Winter Olympics Games are six countries — five of which are located in warmer climates: Ecuador, Eritrea, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore. 
The athletes who are participating have one thing in common: Most of them are not based in the countries they are representing, and are training elsewhere.
Those five nations, along with Kosovo, are participants at the Winter Games, involving 92 countries and 3,000 athletes.
Here's how these unlikely countries made it to snowy Pyeongchang.
Ecuador The South American country is represented by cross-country skier Klaus Jungbluth Rodriguez, who fell in love with the sport while studying in Norway.
The 38-year-old is now pursuing a PhD in sports science at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia. He will be competing in the 15 kilometer freestyle skiing.
Matthias Hangst | Getty Images Klaus Jungbluth Rodriguez of Ecuador competes in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships on February 23, 2017 in Finland. Rodriguez founded the Ecuadorian Ski Federation with the help of the country's National Olympic Committee and has raced in international competitions before this foray into the Olympics.
Eritrea Alpine skier Shannon-Ogbani Abeda, a Canadian-Eritrean, will be representing the African country.
He was born in Canada, after his parents fled their home country due to a war. 
The 21-year-old will be participating in giant slalom and slalom skiing.
Abeda, like his fellow athletes from the warm-climate countries, hopes to promote his wintry sport.
""Right now my focus is to go to the Olympics, but afterward I'd like to finish school, do some coaching and get the Eritrean community on some skis,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Malaysia This Southeast Asian country is represented by two athletes.
Born in the capital of Kuala Lumpur, Jeffrey Webb will compete under the Malaysian flag for alpine skiing. The 18-year-old moved to the U.S. at the age of five.
Webb's attempt to represent the country gained momentum after a Malaysian ski association was formed in 2013. He will take part in the giant slalom and slalom events.
Atsushi Tomura | ISU | Getty Images Julian Zhi Jie Yee of Malaysia competes in Four Continents Figure Skating Championships on January 27, 2018 in Taiwan. Figure skater Julian Yee was introduced to the sport by his mother — a former official at the Ice Skating Association of Malaysia — and started doing his turns in an indoor rink. Now, his training takes place at two rinks in local malls.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak gave a shout-out to the two last week on Twitter.
""Good luck to Julian Yee and Jeffrey Web who will be competing in the #WinterOlympics 2018. I am confident that they will bring glory to the country!"" Najib wrote in Malay.
Nigeria Three women will compete in bobsled for the country.
The trio of Nigerian-Americans are former competitive sprinters. One of them, pilot Seun Adigun, who recruited the other two for the attempt, had also competed in the London Summer Olympics in 2012. 
Kirill Kudryavtsev | AFP | Getty Images Nigeria's women's bobsleigh and skeleton team members Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere, Akuoma Omeoga and Simidele Adeagbo attend a welcoming ceremony for the team in the Olympic Village in Pyeongchang ahead of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Setting their sights on the 2018 Winter Games, the three set out to learn bobsled. 
Initially, it seemed like an impossible dream. The team started training in October 2016 by pushing a wooden cart in a sports center.
""I was trying to do my research,"" Akuoma Omeoga told NBC TV affiliate KPRC. ""Because I didn't know what bobsledding was."" 
Beating expectations, success soon followed with their story capturing public imagination — the three have raised $75,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to finance their bold plan.
Also making history is Simidele Adeagbo, who represents the country in skeleton. She is also a former track and field athlete and only started training for the winter sport in recent years.
Singapore The island nation in Southeast Asia will be represented by 18-year-old Cheyenne Goh, who was born in Singapore but moved to Canada at the age of four, where she learned to ice skate.
She will take part in the women's short-track 1,500 meter skating race.

Many cryptocurrency companies such as Kraken do not operate in New York because the state requires them to have a ""BitLicense"" from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Coinbase, Ripple, Circle and bitFlyer USA have the license , and itBit and the Winklevoss twins' Gemini Trust have charters from the financial services department.
""Legitimate entities generally like to demonstrate to their investors that their money will be protected,"" Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement.

Schneiderman's office asked 13 cryptocurrency exchanges on Tuesday to complete a questionnaire by May 1 to share details on areas such as ownership, fees, trading suspensions and money laundering.
Coinbase, the Gemini Trust, bitFlyer USA and four other exchange operators that responded to CNBC's request for comment expressed support for the request.
Powell was the first dissenting voice. He added in his statement that if the attorney general's office did want to talk, ""ask us for a phone call, fly yourself out to San Francisco, invite us for lunch at your office. We can tell you which industry groups to join and where to begin your research.""
Powell said the last time exchanges complied with New York's request for information, they were encumbered with the BitLicense. ""Kraken left New York because New York is hostile to crypto and this 'questionnaire' we received today proves that New York is not only hostile to crypto, it is hostile to business,"" he said.
The San Francisco-based exchange is the 12th largest by overall cryptocurrency trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. For U.S. dollar- bitcoin trading, Kraken ranked fifth by market share, according to CryptoCompare.

4171,The six ways Facebook plans to prevent another Cambridge Analytica incident,"Facebook has responded to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal , saying it will prevent further misuse by enacting restrictions on the use of personal data.
The company said on a post in its Newsroom on Wednesday it was enacting six main initiatives to prevent companies from having access to people's personal data without proper authorization. 
The initiatives include:
* Reviewing all apps that have had access to large amounts of data on its platform, 

* Alerting people who have had their information misused, 
* Turning off access to users' data if the person hasn't used the app in the last three months, 
* Changing Facebook Login data so apps can only see a user's name, profile photo and email address unless the app goes through a further review process, 

* Helping people manage the apps they use on Facebook, and,

* Adding a bug bounty program for people to report and get rewarded if they find instances of app developers incorrectly using people's data. 
The Guardian and The New York Times reported that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica used unauthorized data from a psychology quiz app to target voters during the 2016 U.S. election. The professor who created the app, Aleksandr Kogan, had told Facebook he was creating the app for academic research purposes, but he sold the personal information to Cambridge Analytica. Though only 270,000 people had downloaded the app, because users gave the app access to information on their Facebook friends the data set included info on more than 50 million Facebook profiles.
Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump's campaign, used the information to target potential voters, according to The Guardian and the New York Times. Cambridge Analytica has denied these claims, saying it deleted the information when it was notified it was obtained improperly.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a statement on the situation on his Facebook page on Wednesday , pledging to prevent the misuse of personal information on its platform. Though allowing access to friends' personal information through Facebook apps was stopped in 2014, the company will work to ensure any improperly obtained information will be deleted, make users more aware of who has access to their information and put more restrictions on what information apps can have about users. 
""We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,"" Zuckerberg said.

The company also briefly passed Disney in market value late this month. Shares rose almost 2 percent, reaching a market value of $152.6 billion.
If you invested in Netflix in 2007, when it began its streaming service , that investment would have really paid off. A $1,000 investment would be worth more than $108,000 as of May 25, according to CNBC calculations, or more than 100 times as much, including price appreciation and dividend gains reinvested.
In the charts below, all data splits are adjusted and gain-loss figures do not include dividends, interest, distributions or fees except on cash accounts. The portfolio value represents current holdings and the comparison charts represent current and historical prices of individual benchmarks, stocks or exchange-traded funds.
While Netflix's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results . Plus, competitors like Disney, with plans to launch their own streaming services , could likely pull content, and potentially viewers, from Netflix.
""I think Netflix is in trouble when the big guys start coming after them,"" Laura Martin, an analyst at investment-banking and asset-management firm Needham & Company, said in an interview with CNBC last year.
Still, many experts, including those from Morgan Stanley, aren't so bearish. ""We continue to believe Netflix will scale to a large and highly profitable business, and 1Q results highlight continued momentum on both scale and margins,"" said an analyst from the investment-banking company .
""In a rare combination, subscriber growth exceeded expectations AND expectations for margin expansion for the year increased. Importantly, as the company pivots its incremental spending from content first toward marketing, there are some early signs that operating leverage is increasing and cash burn perhaps peaking.""
Last year, Netflix announced it would spend $7-$8 billion on content in 2018, including for its own original content. The company signed show-runner Shonda Rhimes to an exclusive deal and completed an acquisition with comic-book company Millarworld.
If you're considering investing in Netflix or in the stock market in general, experts advise starting slow. Experienced investors Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest beginning with index funds , which hold every stock in an index, offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

395,"Crude oil prices are perched comfortably above $60, but a top oil watcher warns it won't last","3:32 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:42 
Crude oil hit its highest level in more than three years to start 2018, but one market watcher expects these gains to be short-lived. 
Crude oil blazed through the first few weeks of the year, as signs of a supply-demand balance set off commodities bulls. A rally sent oil prices nearly 6 percent higher for the year, to trade at their best since December 2014. Crude has surged 133 percent since hitting a multi-year low of $27.30 a barrel in February 2016. 
However, market conditions do not currently support crude oil above $60 a barrel, says John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital and a veteran market watcher. He expects a pullback to more reasonable levels in the near-term. 
""As we get into the new year now and another season of refinery maintenance and much lower gasoline demand, I see the base case fundamentally as arguing for lower prices from here at least for a while,"" Kilduff told CNBC's "" Futures Now "" this week. 
High U.S. oil production could also put a dampener on the crude rally, added Kilduff, potentially negating the benefits of a deal among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to restrict supply even further. That would effectively support prices. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that production growth in the U.S., Canada and Brazil would bump non-OPEC supply higher by 1.7 million barrels per day in 2018. U.S. crude supply alone could surpass 10 million barrels a day — beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia for the title of world's largest oil producer. 
Kilduff sees a range of $50 to $55 a barrel as more appropriate for the current market. Crude oil last settled as low as $55 in November, and closed above $63 in Friday's trading. 
In a silver lining for commodity traders, Kilduff does not see a return to the lows seen in 2015 and 2016, when prices cratered below $30. High production levels and weak demand for oil set off a crude selloff in late 2014 that stretched through to early 2016. 
""We're certainly out of the woods that we were in 18 months ago or so when there was abject oversupply of crude oil and refined products,"" said Kilduff. ""The global glut has been worked off to a large degree, in part because of the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement, but also because of other exogenous events that occurred."" 
OPEC members have largely complied with an output deal that has contributed to a correction of the global imbalance between supply and demand. A agreement to cut production went into effect at the beginning of 2017, and is set to expire at year's end after several extensions. 
Two major pipeline outages, including the Keystone XL pipeline, and a string of devastating hurricanes in the latter half of 2017 helped to balance the domestic oil market. Those events temporarily limited U.S. production and created a sharp drawdown in domestic supplies. show chapters",2018-01-20T23:45:00.000+02:00
5731,Ex Facebook board member: I knew 20-year-old Mark Zuckerberg. He's not a bad person,"CNBC.com Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., waits to begin a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees in Washington, D.C. 
Mark Zuckerberg has been under intense scrutiny, testifying Tuesday and Wednesday to Congressional lawmakers about Facebook's privacy practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal . 
Former Facebook board member, Don Graham, spoke out Monday, defending Zuckerberg against those who think the Facebook CEO is a ""bad person"" or believe he's more interested in profits than users — and also to recall what Zuckerberg was like as a 20-year-old on the verge of something huge. 
Graham, who was on the board of Facebook for six years until 2015, first says he met Zuckerberg in January 2005. At the time, Facebook was only nine months old and Graham had never seen the site because it was only available to college students. 
Zuckerberg was shy and pensive, Graham writes in a Facebook post . Photo courtesy Bloomberg Mark Zuckerberg in January, 2007. 
""The youngest of my four children was two years older than Mark; through my kids and their friends, I had an extensive experience of shy, awkward 20-year olds. Mark was, by a mile, the shyest, most awkward 20-year-old I had ever met,"" writes Graham. 
""When I asked a question, there was sometimes a long, long pause before he answered. I wondered: had I somehow offended him? Did he not hear? 
""Actually, he was thinking. I'm from Washington, where opinions are on the tip of people's tongues,"" writes Graham, a former journalist and ex-executive of his family business, The Washington Post. ""Listening — and thinking before answering — wasn't something I was used to seeing."" 
Graham, who attended Harvard like Zuckerberg, commented to the young founder that the rise of Facebook (95 percent of Harvard's students were on the platform at the time, Zuckerberg informed him) would be the downfall of the Crimson, the university newspaper. 
""Mark, wiser than I, laughed and said yes, Facebook could pause and pick up some ad revenue in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But it was much, much more important to reach other colleges before similar products could arise there and get entrenched. 
""Users before revenue,"" writes Graham. ""We talked a little bit about Facebook as a business. The future tech titan did not then know the difference between revenues and profits."" Photo by The Washington Post Don Graham 
Graham says he tried to invest in Facebook, but Zuckerberg turned him down for a better offer. Then Zuckerberg revealed a ""moral dilemma,"" remembers Graham. ""He worried he had been too encouraging in our earlier conversations. I was disappointed but quite impressed by the maturity with which he handled the matter—pretty good for a 20-year old,"" he writes. 
Two years later, Graham says he met with Zuckerberg in Palo Alto and noticed the tech titan's spartan accommodations. 
""We met at his apartment, in which there were four pieces of furniture: a mattress (on the floor), a kitchen table and two wooden chairs. It was about at this time that Mark turned down a billion-dollar offer for Facebook. I noted that he wasn't letting success go to his head,"" says Graham. (In July of 2006, Zuckerberg rejected a $1 billion buyout offer from Yahoo .) 
Sheryl Sandberg , the chief operating officer of Facebook, shared the post by Graham on her own Facebook page, noting Graham has been a trusted advisor. ""Don's recommendation of Mark was a big part of why I joined Facebook,"" Sandberg wrote. 
Graham is not an impartial observer of Zuckerberg: ""Watching him close up, I came to believe he is someone of great decency and good character,"" he writes. 
But Graham does acknowledge the lack of foresight that caused the Facebook privacy breach. 
""Why was Cambridge Analytica permitted to make off with so much user data? Does Facebook tilt us towards polarization and political intransigence?"" Graham writes. 
""There's much more. Slowly and patiently, Mark, Sheryl and their team will make Facebook much better. Should they have acted sooner? Of course. Do they understand how angry many of their users are? I would bet a lot that the answer is yes. Watch the changes they will make,"" says Graham.

Qu said the company had evaluated the potential for solar and wind power in Brazil, including in the northeastern states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte, and in the south of the country.
He said it could use ultra-high voltage transmission technology - which sends huge amount of power long distances with low losses - to connect remote areas that can generate large amounts of wind and solar to population centers in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and the rest of the Americas.
""I've talked to other big power generation companies and they're all worried with the rise of wind power that they'll generate more than they'll use,"" he said. ""But we can install a (transmission line) that can send it where it needs to go. We could even send it all the way to the U.S.""

7121,Trump's divisive CIA director pick Gina Haspel has the votes to get confirmed,"The Senate on Thursday confirmed Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump 's divisive pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.
The intelligence veteran will become the next CIA director and the first woman to lead the spy agency, despite concerns about her role at the CIA when it employed the ""enhanced interrogation"" program that used some tactics broadly considered torture. After controversy surrounding Haspel's qualifications, enough Democrats supported her to secure her confirmation.
The chamber confirmed Haspel by a 54 to 45 vote. Six Democrats supported her, while two Republicans voted against her. Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., who was tortured himself and urged his colleagues to oppose Haspel, was absent while fighting brain cancer.
Trump and top Republicans pressed Senate Democrats to support Haspel. Most did not, even though some of those senators voted to confirm current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to be Trump's first CIA director last year.
Democratic Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Bill Nelson of Florida and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire voted to confirm Haspel. Four of those senators — Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly and Nelson — face re-election this year in states Trump won in 2016.
On the Republican side, McCain's Arizona colleague Sen. Jeff Flake and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted against Haspel.
Haspel's confirmation push got a boost Tuesday, when she wrote a letter to Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman, saying the interrogation program ""is not one the CIA should have undertaken."" Shortly after the letter's release, Warner and two other Senate Democrats announced they would support Haspel.
During a confirmation hearing this month, Haspel tried to convince senators that she would not allow the use of the interrogation tactics that are broadly viewed as torture. Supporters of the enhanced interrogation program such as former Vice President Dick Cheney have disputed the ""torture"" label.
Haspel, who oversaw a secret CIA prison in Thailand, also faced criticism about her role in the CIA's destruction of videotapes showing interrogation sessions.
Repeatedly pressed during the hearing about whether she would allow tactics she considers immoral, Haspel at times evaded senators' questions and noted that the CIA does not have a formal role in interrogations. As a candidate, Trump said he supports the use of waterboarding or worse tactics.
Haspel said she would not restore ""under any circumstances"" an interrogation program at the CIA and supports the ""higher moral standard"" the U.S. holds now.",2018-05-17T22:37:00.000+03:00

Gottlieb told members of Congress he would ""take another look"" at Nuplazid, CNN reports . The FDA told CNN this week it began conducting a new evaluation of the drug several weeks ago, before Gottlieb was questioned about it.
The drug was first approved in 2016.
An FDA spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC the agency is conducting an evaluation of available information about Nuplazid. An Acadia spokesman referred to the FDA's statement, which noted the review does not mean the FDA has determined the drug has a new risk and the agency does not suggest doctors stop prescribing it and patients stop taking it.
Acadia's stock has plummeted 56 percent over the past year.

1365,Ralph Acampora: I am so bullish I have to sit down and calm down,"After the Dow Jones industrial average hit 25,000 on Thursday, the so-called godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, told CNBC he thinks the blue-chip index can soar another 3,000 points this year.
His near-term target is 25,900, which he thinks will be hit ""very easily,"" and his secondary target for the year is 28,700.
""I am so bullish I have to sit down and calm down,"" the director of technical research for Altaira Capital Partners said in an interview with "" Closing Bell .""
And it's not just because of the market action over the last few days, Acampora said. It is because of the market rotation that started occurring in the second half of 2017.
While technology dominated the year, energy and financials rallied in the second half, he explained. Plus consumer discretionary and consumer staples began playing a game of catch-up.
""This rotation is very powerful. ... We have a heck of a lot more left,"" he said.
Acampora said stocks that haven't performed in 2017, such as IBM and Exxon Mobil , will start to take over some of the leadership.
In fact, he'd start making positions in Exxon and Halliburton , which he said have a lot more room to run. He also likes Bank of America to buy and put away for 5 years.

6717,Ex-Volkswagen CEO Winterkorn charged in US over diesel scandal,"Federal prosecutors in Detroit on Thursday unsealed charges against former Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to mislead regulators about the German automaker's diesel emissions cheating.
Volkswagen did not immediately comment
An indictment filed in secret in March was unsealed in U.S. District Court on the same day as Volkswagen's annual meeting in Germany. Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the charges show ""Volkswagens scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company.""
Winterkorn is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015 by using illicit software that allowed Volkswagen diesel vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection.
Volkswagen initially suggested that only lower level executives knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn was informed of VWs diesel emissions cheating in May 2014 and in July 2015 and he agreed with other senior VW executives ""to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators,"" prosecutors said.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit said Winterkorn was not in custody. In total, nine people have been charged and two have pleaded guilty in the case. One Italian citizen, a former Audi manager, is in Germany awaiting extradition.
Six of the former Volkswagen executives charged are in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors because Germany typically does not extradite its citizens.",2018-05-03T22:34:00.000+03:00
5999,COLUMN-Daycare costs harder to afford than college for many,"COLUMN-Daycare costs harder to afford than college for many Gail MarksJarvis
(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)
CHICAGO, May 23 (Reuters) - Americans are not having enough babies.
The nations fertility rate hit a record low in 2017, and one has to wonder: Could the cost of raising children be discouraging a generation that was choked by the Great Recession?
Employment is strong, but pay has been stagnant. College student loans average $35,000, and renting or buying a home is unaffordable in most metro areas. Throw daycare costs of $10,000 a child into the mix, and families ask themselves: How can they afford a baby?
Childcare is the third-largest expense in the family budget, behind food and housing, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which calculated last year that middle class families spend $233,610 raising a child to the age of 18.
Daycare is a crisis and a much bigger problem than college, says Betsey Stevenson, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, who wonders why there is not a massive public outcry for relief.
Both presidential candidates raised the issue in the last campaign, and Congress then doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.
But there has been no daycare legislation. Rather than organizing politically, it appears that 20- and 30-somethings are voting with their reproductive systems.
The only age group with a rising fertility rate in 2017 was women 40 to 44 years old, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. In addition, 20 percent of parents in a Care.com survey said they would have fewer children than they wanted because of childcare costs.
Lisa Anderson, 30, is among the stressed-out mothers. She commutes daily from a rural home to work at her government consulting job in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota, devoting a quarter of her family income to her 10-month-old sons daycare.
She worries how she and her husband will afford a second child. Daycare for one baby costs close to $10,000; with two, it would total half of the couples take-home income.
With about $1,000 in monthly student loan payments, Im starting to regret what I spent on graduate school, Anderson said. But she and others in her generation cannot undo past decisions, they can only control when and if they'll have children.
BIG COSTS
For working parents, daycare costs are rising at almost twice the nations inflation rate since the recession.
Government guidelines suggest a ratio of 10 percent of income for childcare. But the median family with children under six earned $68,808 in 2016, about $20,000 short of making the median $8,320 annual daycare cost affordable, according to a Brookings Institute analysis of Census data.
Infant care at $10,400 is harsher, and the quality daycare preferred by people with incomes over $150,000 costs $11,652, according to Brookings analyst Grover Whitehurst. In expensive areas of the country, that goes up to $18,000 per child.
Nannies are even more costly averaging about $28,905 a year nationally, according to Care.com. As a result, only about 4 percent of families use them, according to Census data.
Most parents have limited options for cutting costs other than drawing on help from family, sharing caregivers, compromising quality and having fewer children.
Some states offer subsidies, but most go to low-income people. Families get a little tax relief if they claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit at tax time or use a flexible spending account at work to stash money away for childcare on a pre-tax basis.
Financial planners calm parents by telling them they can catch up with retirement and college saving after their children enter school.
But Rachel Brewer, a San Diego mother of three children between seven and nine, questions that. Kids were the cheapest when babies. I spent $5 for a can of formula. Now, I sweat bullets every time I take the kids to the dentist, she said. (Editing by Beth Pinsker and Dan Grebler)",2018-05-23T16:00:00.000+03:00

6205,New book says Obama struggled with Trump's election: 'I've got the economy set up well for him',"Kevin Lamarque | Reuters Barack Obama
Former President Barack Obama struggled with the result of the 2016 presidential election, which ended in victory for President Donald Trump , according to The New York Times' review of the upcoming memoir by Obama advisor Ben Rhodes.
In ""The World as It Is,"" Rhodes wrote that Obama endured a series of emotions following Trump's election and focused on cheering up his staff before sinking into disbelief.
Rhodes wrote that Obama was shocked that Americans elected a ""cartoon.""
""I've got the economy set up well for him,"" Obama said. ""No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.""
The economy significantly improved under Obama, who took office during the financial crisis. The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in 2009, Obama's first year in the White House, but it had fallen to 4.7 percent by the time he handed power to Trump. Stock markets also bounced back dramatically, and there were 75 consecutive months of job growth .
Under Trump, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in its most recent reading , the lowest point since 2000.
Rhodes also wrote that Obama's aides assured him that Obama would have won the election if he were permitted to run for another term, saying he had more in common with the next generation than Trump. However, this didn't seem to cheer up Obama, who wondered whether his presidency came 10 or 20 years too early, according to the book.
Trump has publicly blasted many of Obama's policies, including protections for children brought to the U.S. illegally, trade deals and the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump recently withdrew . He has also sought to undo many of Obama's policy achievements, such as the Affordable Care Act.
After Trump's election, Obama reportedly said: ""We're about to find out just how resilient our institutions are, at home and around the world.""
""The World as It Is"" is set for release on June 5.
The White House and the office of Barack and Michelle Obama did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. ",2018-05-31T18:12:00.000+03:00

Tariffs will amount to 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports, and could go into effect as early as next week. Since the announcement, concerns of retaliation and a trade war have flared globally, and companies are warning that they will suffer as a result.
Here's what's being said about Trump's move, across the world.

5392,Judge agrees to delay Stormy Daniels' lawsuit against Trump,"A judge on Friday delayed a lawsuit by porn actress Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump and his personal attorney.
Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen , asked for the delay after FBI agents raided his home and office earlier this month. The FBI was seeking records about a nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed days before the 2016 presidential election.
U.S. District Judge S. James Otero agreed to pause the case for three months and set a hearing for July 27.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and sued to invalidate the confidentiality agreement that prevents her from discussing it. She's also suing Cohen, alleging defamation.
Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, tweeted that he'd likely be filing an immediate appeal of Otero's ruling with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
""We do not agree with it,"" Avenatti wrote. ""Justice delayed is justice denied.""
Cohen argued that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination could be jeopardized if the proceedings weren't delayed.
His attorney said in court last week that because the criminal investigation overlaps with issues in the lawsuit, his client's right against self-incrimination could be adversely impacted because he won't be able to respond and defend himself.
Cohen said in court records that FBI agents had seized his electronic devices and documents that contain information about the $130,000 Daniels was paid as part of the agreement. Agents also seized communications with his lawyer, Brent Blakely, about the civil case, Cohen said.
Daniels has offered to return the $130,000 and argues the agreement is legally invalid because it was only signed by her and Cohen, not by Trump.
Cohen will assert his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination ""in connection with all proceedings in this case,"" he wrote.

5917,Longtime Paul Ryan associate is courting donors as he gears up to run for speaker's House seat,"A man who used to work as Paul Ryan 's personal driver is gearing up to run for the outgoing House speaker's seat in Wisconsin's 1st District, CNBC has learned.
The potential Republican candidate, Bryan Steil, has been courting some of Wisconsin's top donors as he prepares to enter the fray, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on the condition of anonymity. The race has become one of the most high-profile midterm House contests since Ryan said Wednesday he wouldn't run for re-election.
Steil also had discussions with the leadership of the Wisconsin state Republican delegation — some of whom consider Steil a prime contender to keep the seat in the GOP's hands, other sources tell CNBC.
The state Republican delegation declined to comment.
Ryan's retirement gave the Democrats some momentum in the district, particularly pro-union Army veteran Randy Bryce. Nonpartisan elections analysis site Sabato's Crystal Ball is now calling the race a ""toss-up"" after the speaker's announcement.
Steil currently is the general counsel and secretary at Charter NEX Films Inc., an independent producer of polyethylene film used for food and consumer packaging. He also is on the University of Wisconsin System's board of regents.
He serves as the first vice chairman on the Rock County Republican board. The largest town in the county is Janesville, home of the Ryan family.
Steil's deep family roots in Wisconsin make him an ideal recruit for those looking for a counter to any Democratic candidate that could oppose him. Both his father and grandfather were private attorneys that worked with clients across the Badger State.
Steil's work under Ryan, though, may be the biggest key for him to gain voters' trust. He worked as a personal driver for Ryan back in the Republican leader's early days in the House. In a 2014 interview with Isthmus, a weekly Wisconsin newsletter, Steil indicated that he learned from the speaker's style of leadership.
""He's a guy who tells you what he's going to do, explains it, and then goes to Washington and acts on his beliefs,"" Steil said of Ryan. He also added in that same interview that he respected Ryan because he's willing to have ""an adult conversation.""
Steil declined to be interviewed for this story. A spokeswoman for Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
When told of the news that Steil was on the verge of jumping into the race, state political consultants explained that he had been considering such a move since Ryan decided to run for vice president in 2012.
""Bryan has been putting these plans together for years and made his desire known to serve the 1st District back when Paul was asked to serve as vice presidential candidate,"" Brandon Scholz, a veteran Republican strategist in Wisconsin, told CNBC. ""Since that time he's been involved with state politics and cutting his teeth in the business community.""
Several other Republicans will likely join Steil in a potential primary, scheduled for Aug. 14. Whoever wins will face an energized Democratic base that is swelling with confidence after Ryan's sudden announcement.
That was particularly evident with Democratic candidate Bryce, who has gained some momentum in the fundraising game.
His campaign recently announced he raised $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, almost double the $1.2 million he raised in the previous quarter.
That said, Steil could inherit some of his former boss's fundraising prowess. Team Ryan, the speaker's joint fundraising committee, raised a record $11 million in the first quarter of 2018 and transferred more than $40 million from its war chest to the NRCC.",2018-04-13T00:05:00.000+03:00

But the campaign also warned that if the lawsuit is allowed to proceed by a judge, the campaign will use the legal discovery process to ""explore the DNC's now-secret records about the actual corruption they perpetrated to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.""

Trump Campaign Responds to Frivolous DNC Lawsuit
NEW YORK, NY – Today, the Democratic National Committee filed a wide-ranging, partisan civil lawsuit in federal court against the Trump Campaign, WikiLeaks, and the Russian Government. In response, Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. notes that this frivolous lawsuit is a last-ditch effort to substantiate the baseless Russian collusion allegations by a nearly-bankrupt Democratic Party still trying to counter the will of the people in the 2016 presidential election. This civil lawsuit is completely without merit and will be dismissed in due time.
""This is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,"" said Brad Parscale, Campaign Manager of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. ""With the Democrats' conspiracy theories against the President's campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC's fundraising, they've sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them. There is a great deal the American public wants to know about the corruption of the Democrats, their collusion to influence the 2016 presidential election, and their role in prompting a scam investigation of the Trump Campaign. While this lawsuit is frivolous and will be dismissed, if the case goes forward, the DNC has created an opportunity for us to take aggressive discovery into their claims of 'damages' and uncover their acts of corruption for the American people,"" he concluded.
If this lawsuit proceeds, the Trump Campaign will be prepared to leverage the discovery process and explore the DNC's now-secret records about the actual corruption they perpetrated to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Everything will be on the table, including:
• How the DNC contributed to the fake dossier, using Fusion GPS along with the Clinton Campaign as the basis for the launch of a phony investigation.
• Why the FBI was never allowed access to the DNC servers in the course of their investigation into the Clinton e-mail scandal.
• How the DNC conspired to hand Hillary Clinton the nomination over Bernie Sanders.
• How officials at the highest levels of the DNC colluded with the news media to influence the outcome of the DNC nomination.
• Management decisions by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Brazile, Tom Perez, and John Podesta; their e-mails, personnel decisions, budgets, opposition research, and more.

2914,Money pours into latest battleground for Democratic party's future,"CNBC.com 
A House district in Chicago's suburbs is the latest battleground for the Democratic Party's future. 
Big money has flowed into Tuesday's fight for centrist Democratic Rep. Daniel Lipinski's Illinois 3rd District seat, which he has held since 2005. Outside groups have put millions into the Democratic primary to prop up both Lipinski and his challenger, marketing executive Marie Newman, who has cast herself as a more progressive option. 
The primary in Illinois marks the latest in the fights pitting Democrats who consider themselves moderates against candidates to their left who argue for change or fresh blood. Backers of Lipinski and Newman have spent accordingly. 
Lipinski's campaign already took in more than $920,000 through the end of February, more than it has ever raised previously, according to the Federal Election Commission. Newman's campaign had a fundraising edge at the end of last month, taking in more than $1 million. Lipinski's committee crucially had about $1 million more in cash on hand than Newman's at that point. Kamil Krzacznski | Reuters Congressman Daniel Lipinski (R) campaigns for re-election at the Chicago Ridge Metro commuter train station in Chicago Ridge, Illinois. 
Meanwhile, in a sign of the national interest in the race, outside organizations have piled more than $2.6 million into the primary, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Some of those groups have filled the cash void for Newman. About $1.3 million of the spending has gone toward opposing Lipinski, largely from a newly-spawned Super PAC called Citizens for a Better Illinois. Groups such as the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List have spent more than $900,000 to oppose Newman. 
That cash flow underscores the national interest in the race as a proxy for the direction of the Democratic Party. Outside groups spent only a tiny fraction of this year's total in the district in the 2016, 2014, 2012 and 2010 elections combined. 
Lipinski, as co-chair of the Blue Dog Coalition, has cast himself as a centrist who can cooperate with Republicans. He opposes abortion rights and voted against the Affordable Care Act when the House passed it in 2009. 
The congressman has come under increasing electoral threat as Democratic voters have appeared to move further left. Newman has called him a ""Trump Democrat"" and attacked him for his abortion stance and health-care vote. 
Lipinski has repeatedly highlighted his efforts to oppose the tax plan and health-care overhaul backed by President Donald Trump . 
The race has left the national Democratic Party with tough choices. House Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has not outwardly endorsed Lipinski. 
Meanwhile, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — a progressive leader — and Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have both backed Newman. Sanders and Gillibrand are often mentioned as potential Democratic candidates for president in 2020. 
The contest between Lipinski and Newman will likely determine the eventual winner of the general election. The congressman and his father, William Lipinski, have held the seat since 1993. It is considered a safe Democratic district. 
Polling in the race has been scarce. One survey conducted in February by Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found Lipinski had a 2-percentage point advantage, within the survey's margin of error.

3766,"US-South Korea trade deal is really 3 deals in 1, says US trade rep Robert Lighthizer","U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said a deal with South Korea reforms three separate areas of the trade relationship: steel, currency and the 6-year-old pact known as KORUS.
""I would say you have to think of this as really three agreements that are independent but that define a relationship,"" Lighthizer said Wednesday on CNBC's "" Squawk Box .""
In the deal announced by the Trump administration Tuesday, South Korea has agreed to cut its average annual steel exports to the U.S. by 30 percent, which Lighthizer said is a boon for American steel makers.
""A lot of people believe, and I think I agree with them, that Korea is part of the problem on steel,"" he said.
The U.S. trading partner will also be subject to a 10 percent tariff on aluminum.
On currency, Lighthizer said the agreement will establish a process to prevent ""competitive devaluation"" of the dollar, whereby South Korea deliberately lowers its currency to give its exports a competitive edge. The Treasury 's goal in working to prevent this practice is to stabilize the greenback, Lighthizer said.
The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, established in 2007 and known as KORUS, will also receive a tuneup on vehicle sales.
""The president's view has been — and I agree with it — it has not been particularly good for the United States. We've had increases in trade deficits and really not substantial increases in sales,"" Lighthizer said.
To revamp the deal, the Trump administration is postponing a scheduled phaseout of 25 percent tariffs on small truck imports from South Korea. Rather than allow the tariffs to expire in 2021, President Donald Trump has extended the tariff by 20 years, to 2041.
Doing so, Lighthizer said, will protect the U.S. automobile industry against an influx of Korean truck imports.
The deal also doubles the cap on U.S. truck exports to South Korea to 50,000 per manufacturer, and Lighthizer said it will get rid of ""other barriers"" to sales, including certain environmental standards and customs standards.
""So I guess I'd say all three of these are very important, I think they're very historic when taken together and we're very proud of them,"" Lighthizer said.",2018-03-28T16:58:00.000+03:00

Malaysia and Indonesia have elections coming, and religious parties could play a central role in both. 
Political Islam is poised to be a defining element of elections in both countries, which are economic leaders in a fast-growing region. 
The two countries boast significant Muslim populations — Indonesia has the world's largest — and they have histories of pluralism and tolerance. But some political candidates are catering to fundamentalists in order to win over conservative voters, a move that could grant hard-liners greater influence down the line. 
That's a potentially dangerous scenario for both countries. If extremists are emboldened politically, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur risk endangering democratic norms as well as their strategic ties with the United States, analysts warn. Rise of Islamist parties 
Conservative sects of Islam have long prospered in both states, routinely fueling debates about the role of religion in government. But radical organizations have never attained national power, Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, explained in a note earlier this month. show chapters 8:51 AM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 | 01:00 
Indonesia recognizes six official religions and has long operated on a secular philosophy based on the idea of national unity. Malaysia, meanwhile, is a Muslim state but the constitution guarantees freedom of worship for all ethnic groups, which are predominantly Malay, Indian and Chinese. 
But a growing belief that Muslims are ""victims of economic and political injustice"" has empowered Islamist entities as of late, risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a January brief. 
Represented by names such as Indonesia's Islamic Defenders Front (FDI) and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), those factions advocate Islamic law, or Sharia, and seek to roll back protections for minorities. Such groups are riding on growing anti-minority sentiment across the region, Eurasia said. Risky alliances in Indonesia 
Some Malaysian and Indonesian candidates running in upcoming elections are looking to capitalize on that attitude as they seek new allies to boost their chances of success. 
""Political Islam is on an upward swing in both countries, and can be expected to mobilize and deliver voters,"" said Anthony Nelson, director at consultancy Albright Stonebridge Group's East Asia and Pacific practice. 
Indonesia's vote — scheduled for 2019 — will likely see incumbent President Joko Widodo , or Jokowi, face off against former Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto for the second consecutive time. 
""Prabowo was defeated by Jokowi in 2014, so he has begun to lay the groundwork for expanding his coalition by reaching out to Islamist groups,"" Nelson explained. 
Subianto has not yet officially declared his candidacy, but has reportedly allied with the FDI. The group led 2016 Jakarta protests against Christian politician Basuki Tjahaja Purnama. 
Subianto, who fronts the Gerindra party, is trying to portray himself as more receptive to less affluent Muslims and take advantage of Jokowi's perceived lack of religious credentials, said Vedi Hadiz, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Melbourne. 
""While Indonesia is predominantly Muslim, there is a narrative that suggests ethnic Chinese and Christians have disproportionately benefited economically from state favor since colonial times,"" he explained. 
Representatives at Gerindra did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. Marina Mahathir sees 'divisions' 
It's a similiar story in Malaysia , where an election must be called by August 2018. 
Prime Minister Najib Razak's ruling coalition — the United Malays National Organisation or UMNO — has been warming to PAS, a group that aims to increase the power of Sharia courts and impose Sharia-based punishments for certain criminal offenses. 
The alliance claims to represent Malay Muslims and depict detractors as ""anti-Malay, anti-Muslim or foreign puppets,"" according to Hadiz. Getty Images Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. 
The UMNO did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. 
UMNO's tie-up with PAS ""creates divisions within the populations and influences the way people like judges think,"" warned Marina Mahathir, a political activist and daughter of former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad , who is Najib's main opponent in this year's vote. 
She noted the possibility that UMNO may simply be ""stringing PAS along"" for the sake of winning voters, suggesting that the ruling coalition could abandon the radical group upon victory. 
When asked how 92-year-old Mahathir would handle religious politics if re-elected, she said her father "" knows his religion — the problem now is that we have a weak leader who doesn't know his religion and is outsourcing it to PAS.""

3851,"UPDATE 1-Big Corn, Big Oil square off in White House biofuels meeting","UPDATE 1-Big Corn, Big Oil square off in White House biofuels meeting Jarrett Renshaw Published 10:09 AM ET Tue, 27 Feb 2018 Reuters 
(Adds details, context) 
Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will gather with senators and Cabinet officials on Tuesday to discuss ways to lower the cost of the nations biofuels policy to refiners, a meeting that will pit Big Corn against Big Oil. 
The meeting reflects rising concern in the White House over the current state of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel, which has increasingly divided two of Trump's most important constituencies. 
A refining company in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy. 
Tuesday's meeting will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to sources briefed on the meeting. 
The meeting will also include White House legislative director Marc Short, who will seek to ensure any agreement can be achieved through executive orders and regulatory actions defensible in court, the sources said. 
Representatives for the officials declined to comment. The White House will issue a statement later Tuesday, spokeswoman Kelly Love said. 
U.S. farm groups urged Trump in a letter on Monday not to weaken the RFS, calling it a critical engine of rural jobs. ""Any action that seeks to weaken the RFS for the benefit of a handful of refiners will, by extension, be borne on the backs of our farmers,"" the groups said. 
The meeting comes alongside a legislative effort to alter the RFS, led by Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, which faces stiff resistance from corn states. 
Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase biofuel blending credits called RINs to prove to the federal government that enough biofuels are being blended into their gasoline and diesel to comply with the policy. 
As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years, however, so have prices for the credits. Refiners that do not have their own blending facilities are required to buy the credits and are facing rising costs. 
Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than 1,000 people, filed for bankruptcy protection last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. 
Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. 
Other refiners, like vocal RFS-opponent Valero Energy Corp and Marathon Oil Corp, are pulling in solid profits despite the biofuels regulation. 
America's biggest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland Co and POET LLC. 
HANDFUL OF OPTIONS 
At least four options aimed at reducing the cost of RINs to refiners like PES will be considered, two sources familiar with the agenda of the White House meeting said, though they noted the effort would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts. 
Prices of RINs tumbled by nearly 20 percent in the past week on expectations of a regulatory tweak. 
One idea would be to count U.S. ethanol exports toward annual biofuels volume mandates that are currently focused on domestic usage. The idea has been studied by Agriculture Secretary Perdue, who now favors it, the sources said. 
Another option would be to place a cap on the price of a RIN. Cruz late last year suggested capping RIN prices at 10 cents each, far below the current value of over 60 cents. The move was roundly rejected by biofuels advocates. 
Officials will also consider measures to remove speculation from the RIN market, potentially by limiting transactions to blenders and refiners, those directly involved in generating and consuming them, the sources said. 
Any plan would also likely include a concession to the ethanol industry, they said, such as a waiver to allow gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol to be sold year round. Sales of high-ethanol blends are currently restricted during the summer due to concerns over smog. 
The meeting could also look at solutions focused more directly on refiner PES, like waiving its current RIN obligation valued at about $350 million, the sources said. But such a move would likely draw a backlash from other refiners who have no hope of receiving such a waiver.

2143,Puerto Rico's governor is bullish on blockchain as part of island's comeback,"Cryptocurrency aficionados have been flocking to Puerto Rico, attracted by a provision that exempts relative newcomers to the island from paying taxes on their capital gains.
But the governor of Puerto Rico is not quite sold on crypto.
""Cryptocurrency is sort of an application of that — I am concerned with some of the reports that have been going on there on how this is being used,"" Gov. Ricardo Rossello said in an interview with CNBC. ""So, in my view, there is still a lot of work to be done and giving clarity that this is not used for money laundering or it's not used for other areas.""
Still, he's much more bullish about the prospect of blockchain, something he calls a ""phenomenal technology"" and a ""game changer.""
""We would really, at least my administration, would like to take advantage of the blockchain component of it because it has transformative and disruptive components for business and for government,"" Rossello said.
Puerto Rico is luring crypto entrepreneurs and investors thanks to an exemption within the Internal Revenue Code, called Act 22, that allows nonresidents of Puerto Rico to pay no taxes on their long-term capital gains.
Puerto Rico is calling itself the ""friendliest locale in the United States for entrepreneurs, investors and service providers in the crypto-currency and blockchain arena,"" according to a description of a conference called ""Puerto Crypto,"" which is taking place next month.
The 2½-day conference is partnering with the Puerto Rico Department of Economic Development and the governor's office.

6797,"Cramer's advice for investing in your 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond","CNBC's Jim Cramer says that suitability, or the concept that certain stocks are right for some investors but wrong for others, can last investors a long time once they figure out what's right for them.
But after college, during which the "" Mad Money "" host does not recommend investing or putting away money at all, ""things get less and less suitable,"" he said.
Once you are in the real world, it is critical to start saving, whether it is through an employer-provided 401(k) plan or a self-run Individual Retirement Account, Cramer said, adding that he prefers the latter because it lets you individually pick stocks.
At this point, investors should start putting together the mix between index funds and individual stocks in their portfolios.
""There's too much risk in individual stocks to just put together a portfolio of them of your own choosing,"" Cramer said. ""So, at a minimum, I am demanding that you put your first $10,000 beyond what you have from your first twenty years into an index fund, the S&P 500 being my favorite.""
While some may argue with that strategy, Cramer said that for a person in her 20s, the risk of one bad stock tanking and taking her portfolio down with it is too large. Index fund investments guard against that effect.
After that initial $10,000, Cramer encourages investors to pick stocks while staying diversified and doing their homework after they buy.
""I tell you that you need to buy a stock but then you have to keep up with it,"" he said. ""You no longer need to spend a couple of hours a week studying your stocks. You need to read the conference calls. You can Google articles galore, so many that you'll get sick of the process very quickly.""
Whatever makes investors as comfortable as possible with running their own money is the way to go, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""That's what I want. Confident, not over-confident,"" he added.
When you get to your 20s, Cramer said you must consider what you would do in a sell-off and, following that, how much risk you are willing to take while investing.
Key questions include: Can you handle a decline and buy more on the dip? Will you wish you were not exposed to the downfall at all? Can you accept that stocks go down?
""These are crucial questions that only you can answer,"" Cramer said. ""I would like you to take more risk and more individual stocks that have growth characteristics once you have put away that $10,000. That's my preference. But I would hate to see you commit more than 20 percent of your money, your mad money, to individual stocks. That would not be my preference.""
In your 30s, Cramer recommends accruing more income by buying stocks that pay dividends and possibly investing in a fund with higher dividends than the S&P 500.
Investments in bonds should only be added to your portfolio in your 40s, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""By this time, you should have been able to put enough away that bonds, even lower-earning bonds, will protect some of your invested capital,"" Cramer said.
When you get to your 60s and beyond, Cramer would not oppose investing up to 50 percent of your money in bonds and taking bonds up 10 percent more each decade.
But if you cannot handle the risk and think the stock market is too unstable for you, the ""Mad Money"" host stressed deciding for yourself if cashing out might be the better move.
""The bottom line? It's your life, not mine,"" he said. ""So get comfortable with what you can live with. But risk, at least until your middle years, should remain a friend.""

5073,Yahoo Japan to buy minority stake in a cryptocurrency exchange,"Yahoo Japan Corp said on Friday it would buy a minority stake in a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange, becoming the latest major Japanese financial services provider to shrug off security concerns and join the digital money industry.
Yahoo Japan, which is also the country's biggest online auction site, said in a statement it would buy through a subsidiary a 40 percent stake in BitARG Exchange Tokyo, with services planned for launch in the autumn.
Yahoo Japan did not give details of the value of the investment. But a person familiar with the matter said it would likely total 2 billion to 3 billion yen ($18.6 million to $27.9 million).
Shares in Yahoo Japan closed down 0.2 percent, against a 0.6 gain for the benchmark Nikkei average .
The deal comes after Japanese online brokerage firm Monex Group Inc (8698.T) said last week it would buy hacked cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc for $34 million.
That saw Monex join other mainstream financial services providers such as larger peer SBI Holdings Inc and messaging app operator Line Corp in looking to enter the cryptocurrency industry.",2018-04-13T09:36:00.000+03:00
1571,Mattis: Diplomacy should impose reason on North Korea's Kim Jong Un,"Mattis: Diplomacy should impose reason on North Korea's Kim Jong Un Published 13 Hours Ago Aaron P. Bernstein | Reuters Secretary of Defense James Mattis 
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stressed diplomacy as the way to deal with the North Korean crisis on Friday during talks with his South Korean counterpart in Hawaii, a day after Seoul's top diplomat said a military solution would be unacceptable. 
""Diplomacy should (impose) reason on Kim's reckless rhetoric and dangerous provocations,"" Mattis said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . 
He added that the response to the threat remained ""diplomacy led, backed up with military options available to ensure that our diplomats are understood to be speaking from a position of strength."" 
The administration of President Donald Trump has said all options are on the table when it comes to North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States. 
But Mattis has consistently stressed non-military actions, including international sanctions. He renewed that message as he met South Korean Minister of Defence Song Young-moo at the U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. 
Song said he expected to discuss North Korea with Mattis, but noted firm coordination between the two militaries. 
""We both understand each other well and that as an alliance, we always go together,"" he said, speaking through a translator. 
The exchange came a day after South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program must be resolved diplomatically, and added that she was certain Washington would consult her government first if a military option were to be considered. 
She declined to comment if Washington had given Seoul clear assurance but added: ""This is our fate that is at stake. Any option that is to be taken on the Korean Peninsula, cannot be implemented without us going along."" 
After their first formal talks in more than two years this month, officials from the two Koreas have been visiting each other to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics, to be held in the South's alpine resort town of Pyeongchang. 
North Korea has waged a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for ""all Koreans at home and abroad"" to promote inter-Korean cooperation. 
Kim's regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 — the day before the start of the Games. Analysts say the nation may observe the day with a large military parade. 
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he described as an effort by North Korea to ""hijack"" the Games with a propaganda campaign.",2018-01-27T05:48:00.000+02:00

1122,Bill Miller says he has split most of his bitcoin holdings into separate fund,"6 Mins Ago | 01:51 
Investor Bill Miller said he has split most of his fund's bitcoin holdings into a separate fund. 
The founder of Miller Value Partners said on CNBC on Tuesday that the fund had moved 90 percent of its bitcoin holdings to a separate fund, with the main fund retaining a 10 percent weighting in bitcoin and its offshoot, bitcoin cash. 
This is after the cryptocurrency's meteoric rise in value last year. Miller told CNBC in December that half the value of his fund was in bitcoin. 
He said they began buying bitcoin in 2014 or 2015, at an average cost of about $350. Bitcoin is currently trading near $14 935, according to CryptocurrencyMarket.com. Moving it to a separate fund allows investors to decide whether they want to continue to hold or sell it, he told CNBC. 
Digital currencies have grabbed a lot of attention from investors because of their quick and steep gains in the last few months. A coin created by the startup Ripple dropped 10 percent earlier Tuesday after soaring 35,000 percent last year. Miller told CNBC on Tuesday that the rally in ripple, which is currently trading around $2.18, was ""way overdone."" 
But the interest in new digital coins hasn't gone away. Also on Tuesday, Kodak , a 130-year-old company, announced it will roll out its own digital currency as part of a new photography royalty tracking product. 
""There's probably something out there that makes sense but it takes a lot of digging to find it,"" Miller said about the wave of newer, much cheaper, alternatives to bitcoin. ""It's not exactly, I'd say, careful evaluation going on."" 
Miller founded his fund in 2016 after 35 years as a manager at Legg Mason, where he rose to celebrity by beating the S&P 500 15 years in a row through 2005. He earned a reputation for taking concentrated bets. His fund currently holds bank stocks such as Citigroup, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan.",2018-01-09T23:20:00.000+02:00

2967,'Worlds are being disrupted' by our data-driven approach: Splunk CEO,"Sticking to tradition in retail — specifically, choosing what to sell without having the data to back up the decision — could be what's killing struggling chains.
That's at least if you ask Doug Merritt, the president and CEO of software analytics play Splunk , who told CNBC on Monday that picking items to sell without consulting customer data could land retailers in jeopardy.
""If you're doing it that way, it's going to be harder and harder to be successful,"" Merritt told "" Mad Money "" host Jim Cramer. ""That is not the way that Amazon's doing it. That's not the way that Mercadolibre's doing it. That's not the way Alibaba's doing it.""
""Worlds are being disrupted because people are taking a data-driven approach right now to understanding product velocity [and] customer needs,"" Merritt continued.
Splunk is partnered with Amazon's cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, and boasts clients such as Coca-Cola, Nordstrom, Groupon and the state of Alaska.
The San Francisco-based company helps clients gather real-time data related to their businesses to smooth operations, heighten security and gain eye-opening insights into their customers.
For retailers in particular, Merritt's company hones in on ultra-specific data points that paint a picture of broader customer patterns, wants and needs.
""There are signals — WiFi hotspots, mobile devices, sensors on the stores — that, if you know how to trap, you can do a much better job of understanding what your customers need and listening to that customer so you can be successful,"" the CEO said.
These days, Splunk is moving towards a more ""prescriptive"" model, telling customers not only that they need to harness their data to survive, but also explaining which data points are most useful and how to use them, Merritt told Cramer.
The move is part of Splunk's push to create faster ""time to value"" for their customers, which comes in handy for multinational companies that need to comply with foreign regulations, the CEO said.
But most of all, Merritt said that Splunk's core mission and its partnership with Amazon highlights what companies increasingly need: visibility into customer sentiment and behavior.
""Every company has got to become a data-driven company or they just won't compete going forward,"" Merritt told Cramer, speaking from CNBC's 1Market in San Francisco. ""And Splunk is the best solution out there to help companies understand this multitude of data that is coming in every single day and turn it into a business outcome, a true competitive advantage.""

2504,He sold his last company for $3.4 billion — now Lars Dalgaard will teach tech leaders to empathize,"Lars Dalgaard, who sold SuccessFactors to SAP for $3.4 billion in 2011 before going into venture capital, is stepping down from his general partner role at VC firm Andreessen Horowitz to found his own investment firm.
His focus will be teaching entrepreneurs to lead with ""more heart. Less ego.""
The new fund, which he is tentatively calling Luv Ventures, will invest in ""extraordinary companies that will literally revolutionize the world."" He named synthetic biology, food and enterprise software as areas of interest.
But the main focus will be connecting with CEOs and helping them learn empathetic leadership.
He cites a running joke he had with Marc Andreessen: ""I think Silicon Valley could be 10 to 20 times bigger if 80 percent of the companies were led better.""
The time seems right. Silicon Valley is facing an identity crisis — once the poster child for futuristic innovation, it's increasingly seen as a bunch of rich white guys chasing money at the expense of everybody else, including their employees and society at large.
In 2017, the most valued start-up in the region, Uber, was beset by scandals ranging from widespread sexism to using technology to evade authorities, and ended up replacing CEO Travis Kalanick and other top execs. Tech giants like Facebook, Google and Apple have been slammed for propagating fake news, helping foreign governments influence the U.S. presidential election and/or creating overly addictive products. 
Many of these failures come down to a lack of leadership. And while Dalgaard didn't criticize any company specifically, he noted that technology without good management gets ""stuck.""
""I've been helping people who are very creative, helping people who have nothing but tech in their head. In all cases, they have had no management experience before. Hell, some of them have not even had a job. But if you're committed to wanting to learn constantly how to be a leader and not just get stuck in your own head, around your own ideas and who you used to be, the stories you tell yourself, then I think there is really a breakout.""
But empathetic leadership isn't only better for society, it's better business.
Dalgaard insists that CEOs can't understand how to sell products if they don't understand how to speak the language of their customers.
""The entrepreneurs themselves don't really know what the end customer exactly wants. They can sure visualize how this technology will work, but it's very hard for them to speak the language of the customer,"" he said. ""I think I can help with some really crisp answers on both sides.""
Dalgaard particulary admires Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff , once a fierce competitor and now a friend, as somebody he admires for his social conscience and willingness to ""take daring positions that he might not have been known for originally, but he dances right into it.""
He also deemed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ""extraordinary,"" noting that while Facebook has been through plenty of issues in the last year, Zuckerberg himself has shown humility and a willingness to change. That shows up in the devotion of his employees.
""People just adore working for him. And I'm not talking about a cult. These people are experienced people, they've been with other companies first and they want to work there.""
Other leaders he admires include Amazon 's Jeff Bezos , Google's Larry Page and Stitch Fix CEO Katrina Lake. 
Dalgaard is a bit of an outsider in Silicon Valley himself. Born in Denmark, he spent time at Unilever and Novartis — not two companies associated with the high-tech boom — before founding SuccessFactors in 2001 and taking it public in 2007. After SAP bought the company, he was asked to stick around to help give the company some ""cloud DNA,"" in the words of CEO Bill McDermott . He lasted a little more than a year before joining Andreessen Horowitz in the summer of 2013. 
Although Dalgaard says he has higher purpose than making money, this is definitely an investment fund, not a nonprofit or consulting business.
Dalgaard will begin by investing his own money — something he could not do with Andreessen Horowitz, which does not allow its general partners to invest in companies the firm invests in. He said he already has a couple of prospects who are excited to work with him, though he declined to name them.
He also said he'll look for limited partner investors, particularly corporate investors who are outside the tech sector and want an entry into Silicon Valley. 
Dalgaard will remain a board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, staying on the boards of several companies in which he led investments, including HR software start-up Zenefits and viral image warehouse Imgur. 
He's also looking forward to slowing down a little bit. ""I'm just going to take my time this time, and really meet with the people, and really make sure we're on the same page, because I want this firm to be a legacy that grows beyond me.""

""The stock has moved through this $15 level, a little bit of a near-term breakout,"" Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Monday.
But to get fully get behind GE's rebound, Wald needs to see a shift in its 200-day moving average at the minimum.
""At the least we want to see that 200-day start to turn sideways, ideally even higher,"" said Wald. ""So, best thing we can say is that we wouldn't bet against it, but we're placing our bets elsewhere.""
GE's 200-day moving average has been in decline since April 2017, the last time its shares traded above the technical level, and has fallen 40 percent during the past year.
The options market also remains skeptical of GE's rally, according to Dennis Davitt, partner at Harvest Volatility Management.
""People are not believing in it in the options market,"" Davitt said on Monday's ""Trading Nation."" ""We saw a big buyer of options, shorter-dated options, one-month options, that are expiring — the June $14 put . We've had big buyers of them in the marketplace.""
Put contracts increase in value as a stock declines.
GE shares rose on Monday after the company announced plans to merge its transportation business with rail equipment company Wabtec . The $11 billion deal, expected to close early next year, is the latest in GE's efforts to winnow operations to focus on its core industrial portfolio.
Beyond these deals, Davitt says GE must tackle its balance sheet before he can warm up to the stock.
""Until I see something come out of their liabilities on the financials side, the other stuff is just noise to me and that's kind of what the options market is saying,"" he said.
GE closed out its March-ended quarter with $106.5 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet.",2018-05-22T14:51:00.000+03:00

675,"Hot tech stock Nvidia has even more room to run, says technical analyst","Nvidia has already surged more than 15 percent in the new year, and one trader is betting that the chipmaker has even more room to run.
While chip stocks have been on a tear, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon has his eye on Nvidia in particular thanks to what he believes is a strong performance pattern for the stock.
""I like the technical setup of Nvidia,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" ""You can see that we are well-contained in a parallel trend channel that originated in December and carried through to 2018.""
Additionally, Gordon sees support for Nvidia at around the $217 level after a breakout, which used to be a resistance point from which Nvidia fell back in November. This breakout leads him to believe that should the stock dip, it could still bounce from the $217 level.
In advance of Nvidia's earnings report on Feb. 8, Gordon wants to sell the February monthly 220-strike put and pair that with the purchase of the February monthly 215-strike put. This would allow Gordon to collect a credit of $2.08, or $208, should Nvidia close above $220 on the Feb. 16 expiration.
But if Nvidia closes below $215 on expiration, then Gordon could lose $285. While Nvidia was trading at $224 on Wednesday, the trader wants to establish a point at which to step out.
""If the support at about $217 is broken, the reason for being in this trade is wrong,"" he said.
Nvidia has soared 118 percent in the past year.

2808,Three tiny stocks with same CEO suspended by SEC for questionable cryptocurrency announcements,"Gold Three tiny stocks with same CEO suspended by SEC for questionable cryptocurrency announcements A quick look at three stocks temporarily suspended by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for questions over ties to cryptocurrencies raises a host of other concerns. First, the three companies, Cherubim Interests (CHIT), PDX Partners (PDXP, formerly ""My Social Income"") and Victura Construction (VICT), all list the same chief executive officer in January press releases: Patrick J. Johnson. The companies all announced in January the acquisition of trust units in a private equity fund that strangely claims to be exponentially larger than Blackstone, and Cherubim also said it has made a financing commitment of $100 million to an initial coin offering. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it has temporarily suspended trading in three very tiny stocks due to questions about their cryptocurrency-related announcements. 
The companies announced in January that they each acquired several thousand trust units in a private equity fund called ""NVC Fund"" with investments related to blockchain and cryptocurrency. 
However, those investments appear quite limited. A quick look at public information on the companies and the fund also raises a host of other concerns. 
First, the three companies, Cherubim Interests (CHIT) , PDX Partners (PDXP , formerly ""My Social Income"") and Victura Construction (VICT) , all list the same chief executive officer in January press releases: Patrick J. Johnson. 
His statements in three separate releases about the private equity investment are also worded exactly the same, with a grammatical error. 
Johnson did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment. Phone numbers listed on the websites of Victura and PDXP were not in service and the number listed for Cherubim had a machine recording for Victura. An email to Victura also bounced back. 
The three stocks, which are traded over-the-counter, each have a market capitalization of less than $5 million, according to FactSet. PDX says it is a telecom company, while Victura states it is a holding company for the construction industry and Cherubim says it is an alternative construction and real estate development company. Each share had a value of $0 on Friday, according to FactSet. 
Second, the companies all announced in January the acquisition of trust units in private equity fund NVC that claims to be exponentially larger than Blackstone. 
""NVC Fund"" is a private equity fund that invests in ""Blockchain Technology, Fintech Cryptocurrency"" and other various industries, according to the press releases. 
""We have a block of assets that we digitize,"" Frank Ekejija, head of NVC, said in a phone interview with CNBC Friday. He said the company also has an ""NVC Fund Coin"" for an internal platform. 
Ekejija said he did not have any direct comment on the SEC trading suspension and that the agreement to acquire trust units in NVC has not concluded yet. 
NVC Fund Holding Trust lists ""Reverend Frank Ekejija"" as its chairman, trustee and CEO and also states Ekejija holds an MA and MBA from Northfield University. The degrees are not listed on his LinkedIn profile page. 
Ekejija said he holds the degrees and the website has not been updated since 2004. He also said NVC Fund has $10 trillion in assets under management, which would be more than the whole private equity industry. 
Blackstone, a leading private equity firm, had $434 billion in assets under management at the end of last year. 
Third, one of the companies the SEC suspended trading in, Cherubim Interests, is involved with a sale of a new digital coin. A whitepaper shows the coin is backed by a company led by ""Elder Jeffre Saint James, D. PSc, MBA, ordained minister, and a Service Disabled Veteran."" 
James does not list any education on his LinkedIn profile page. James' company, the Saint James Holdings and Investment Company Trust, did not immediately respond to a CNBC phone call and an email to the provided address bounced back. 
Cherubim said in a Jan. 3 release that it has executed a financing commitment of $100 million to launch an initial coin offering for ""The Self-Sustaining Intentional Communities Coin (Symbol SJT)."" 
""The sale of the coins will generate capital to create self-sustaining intentional communities across the US and across 57 nations,"" the release said. ""Municipal and rural infrastructures may be improved through the investment into eco-friendly housing and businesses that create products and services for the benefits of the community and to consumers."" 
The SEC added in Friday's release that it suspended trading in Cherubim shares ""because of its delinquency in filing annual and quarterly reports."" 
Trading in all three stocks is suspended until midnight on March 2. 
""This is a reminder that investors should give heightened scrutiny to penny stock companies that have switched their focus to the latest business trend, such as cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, or initial coin offerings,"" Michele Wein Layne, director of the Los Angeles regional office for the commission, said in a statement. 
Friday's announcement is the latest in an increasing number of trading suspensions and SEC actions against companies involved with initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies. ",2018-02-16T22:31:00.000+02:00
3348,Dick’s Sporting Goods shares tumble on revenue miss,"Dick's Sporting Goods on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that slightly topped analysts' estimates, but revenue and same-store sales fell short.
Its shares were down more than 8 percent in early trading following the announcement.
Net income totaled $116 million, or $1.11 a share, for the quarter ended Feb. 3, compared with $90.2 million, or 81 cents per share, a year ago.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.22 a share, 2 cents above analysts' estimates in a Thomson Reuters survey.
Revenue was $2.66 billion, below analysts' expectations for $2.74 billion in sales.
Same-store sales were down 2 percent overall for the holiday period, Dick's said, while analysts had forecast a decline of just 1 percent. Same-store sales grew 5 percent during the period a year earlier.
""As expected, margins remained under pressure, however the decline was less than we anticipated,"" CEO Ed Stack said in a statement. ""In 2018, we expect stronger product innovation from select key partners and the continued expansion of our private brands to result in less margin pressure than previously expected.""
Dick's said it will no longer provide analysts and investors with a quarterly outlook ""to more closely align with industry practices.""
The company is calling for full-year earnings per share to fall within a range of $2.80 to $3. Same-store sales are expected to decline as much as a low-single digit percentage, compared with a 0.3 percent drop in fiscal 2017.
Dick's said it expects to open about 19 stores in 2018 and to relocate four shops to different buildings. It's not planning to open any new Field & Stream or Golf Galaxy stores this year.
For Dick's, ""some of the positives are being overlooked,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow has said. This includes favorable winter weather, an Eagles Super Bowl championship that likely lifted sales, and new regulations for Little League baseball bats that recently went into effect, which should draw shoppers into stores this spring for replacements.
To be sure, the retailer faces continued pressure from discount retailers and Amazon to offer items at lower prices. Brands like Nike and Under Armour are investing in selling more merchandise directly to consumers.
Dick's private-label lines, including Second Skin and Calia by Carrie Underwood, are one way the company is trying to combat margin pressure. It's also been making a bigger push to win shoppers online, and e-commerce sales grew 9 percent during the fourth quarter.
Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods have fallen more than 37 percent from a year ago.
Two weeks after the Feb. 14 shooting massacre in Parkland, Florida, CEO Stack announced that Dick's was halting sales of assault-style rifles and was ending sales of any gun to anyone under 21 years old.",2018-03-13T13:45:00.000+02:00

3146,Dropbox raises long-term profit outlook in confidential slideshow for prospective investors,"Dropbox executives revealed to investors their long-term targets for expanded gross and operating margins, according to a photo from the company's investor presentation.
The photo was obtained by CNBC from an attendee inside the company's New York roadshow meeting Monday as part of its initial public offering marketing.
The slide, marked ""confidential,"" indicates that the company's long-term targets for gross margins are between 76 percent and 78 percent, up from 68 percent in 2017. Dropbox also plans to increase operating margins to a target between 18 percent and 20 percent, up from 5 percent last year. The time-frame for ""long-term"" was not identified on the slide.
These long-term targets have not been previously disclosed through the company's initial public offering prospectus.
As part of the marketing surrounding its IPO, Dropbox hosted hundreds of investors at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel. Drew Houston, the chief executive, spoke, as did Dropbox's chief financial officer, Ajay Vashee, and chief operating officer, Dennis Woodside. The company's advisers from Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank were also in attendance.
Additional photos provided to CNBC show a slide that highlights the company's 35-point margin improvement since 2015, which Dropbox attributes to ""efficient data management, owned infrastructure."" Another slide focused on the company's revenue and free-cash flow improvements over the last three years.
A spokeswoman for Dropbox didn't comment or confirm the authenticity of the photos.
Like many start-ups, Dropbox ran its service atop Amazon Web Services for the first years of operation, but began to build its own infrastructure beginning in 2015, and has moved core operations off Amazon to its own systems.
Dropbox will hold another lunch in Boston on Thursday before heading to the West Coast and Midwest next week. The company intends to price its shares next Thursday, with trading on Friday, a person familiar with the matter said. That timing could change based on market conditions and other factors.

5745,"3 easy ways to ‘spring clean’ your work life, according to a Stanford professor","11:12 AM ET Tue, 8 Aug 2017 | 01:17 
It's officially spring in the U.S. and over 75 percent of Americans are getting ready to do their annual spring cleaning at home, the American Cleaning Institute found in a recent survey. 
While this time of the year is often associated with cleaning your house and removing clutter, Stanford professor Emma Seppala says now is also a great time to ""spring clean your mind"" and work life. 
""Given that we take in [at least] 64 GB of information every day, according to research from UC San Diego , there's probably a lot of clutter in our minds,"" Seppala, author of "" The Happiness Track ,"" tells CNBC Make It. 
Factoring in the time people spend at their desks multitasking between desktops and mobile phones, checking email, browsing social media and streaming videos, Americans consume media about 12 hours a day . show chapters 10:36 AM ET Fri, 7 April 2017 | 00:59 
""The more information we fill our minds with, the poorer our ability to remember things becomes,"" Seppala says. ""The brain literally acts as if it were cluttered and we're less able to ignore irrelevant information."" 
Here are three of Seppala's tips that will help you be more productive and successful at work this spring: Take more deep breaths 
If you ever find yourself constantly checking your inbox for new work emails, there is an easy way to cut that habit out of your daily routine: Do breathing exercises. 
""One of the easiest and fastest ways to lower your heart rate and blood pressure is to slow down your breathing, especially your exhales,"" Seppala says. ""In minutes, you can calm yourself down."" 
This exercise is not only easy to do at your desk, but it's quiet and doesn't draw much, if any, attention from your coworkers. Taking deep, slow breaths reduces anxiety and stress , research finds. Have some fun 
As adults, many people feel like they don't have time to be creative and engage in playful activities, Seppala notes. But studies show that when people do entertain their childlike side, they actually feel less bogged down by work. 
""Play has a positive impact on creativity because—in addition to helping us both mind-wander and diversify — it stimulates positive emotion, which research shows leads to greater insight and better problem solving,"" Seppala writes in ""The Happiness Track."" show chapters 11:24 AM ET Fri, 6 Jan 2017 | 01:14 
For workers, this may look like taking team meetings outdoors, going to a comedy show with coworkers or playing a game of pool. 
""When we feel good, we gain the ability to pay attention to a wider range of experiences,"" Seppala writes. ""In other words, if you feel stuck in a rut or you can't think yourself out of a problem or don't see a way out of a situation, play may be a way of getting 'unstuck' and coming up with innovative ideas."" Add some plants to your office 
""In terms of spring cleaning your career, add plants to your office,"" Seppala recommends. ""Research shows it will improve your mental well-being significantly."" 
Having greenery at your desk or around your office has the ability to clear the air quite literally, as one NASA study found plants remove indoor toxins in the air. 
According to a study from the University of Exeter, having plants in the office can also increase concentration, workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life. The study further found that plants make workers more physically, cognitively and emotionally involved in their work. 
""Similarly, resolve to take walks outside on your breaks instead of scrolling through your phone,"" she says. ""This small action can significantly boost your happiness.""",2018-04-05T17:35:00.000+03:00

3267,"Trump wants to 'go after' Amazon over taxes, but others in government could settle the issue for him","President Donald Trump reportedly wants to take on Amazon and the internet retail behemoth's tax treatment. 
It is unclear what the president would, or could, do on his own, but actions in the two other branches of government could settle the issue for him. 
The president has long argued that Amazon gets unfair tax treatment relative to brick-and-mortar retailers. Trump is ""obsessed"" with Amazon and wants to ""go after"" the company, Axios reported on Wednesday , citing sources. The company's stock, in turn, lost more than $50 billion in shareholder value at one point Wednesday.
On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the White House planned any imminent move against Amazon. ""We have no announcement and no specific policies we are pushing for"" related to Amazon, she said. 
The president's reported stance on the company isn't new. In several tweets in recent years, Trump has argued for changes in how Amazon purchases get taxed. At issue is whether a state sales tax is levied on purchases made from a third-party Amazon vendor. 
Trump tweet 
Last year, the online retailer started to collect sales taxes on products it sells directly to consumers in states that levy such taxes. But some retail competitors argue the policy for third-party vendors gives Amazon an unfair advantage. 
What can the government do?  In February, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the House's tax-writing committee that Trump ""feels strongly"" that the government should permit sales taxes on purchases made over the internet. Congress has the power to levy taxes, and it is unclear whether the Treasury can take any action itself against Amazon. 
Even if the Trump administration takes no concrete actions itself, the agency and Trump himself could encourage Congress to pass legislation. 
Some lawmakers have proposed legislation to settle the issue, but proposals have not gained traction in Congress. Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., tried to attach a measure related to an internet sales tax to the $1.3 trillion spending bill that Trump signed into law last week. 
Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks to the press in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, October 16, 2017. The provision would allow states to collect sales taxes from the buyer based on the rate in the buyer's home state. Noem wanted to pass the bill before a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the issue later this year, to give retailers more certainty. 
Some conservatives have criticized proposals to uniformly levy state sales taxes because more costs could fall to consumers. While Noem said earlier this month that she opposes a tax increase, she said ""out-of-state online retailers are aggressively exploiting a tax loophole, giving them a competitive advantage over local businesses."" 
""Only Congress can fix this problem in a thoughtful way that equips small business owners with the tools needed to comply with existing law, shields local job creators from egregious out-of-state audits, and levels the playing field,"" she said in a statement. 
The measure did not make it into the spending bill and appears stalled in Congress. It is unclear whether Congress would take up the issue at Trump's urging.
The Senate Finance Committee declined to comment. A representative for the House Ways and Means Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment. 
The Supreme Court considers the matter The issue is likely to be settled in court before Congress has a chance to do something about it. 
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court agreed to listen to arguments over internet sales taxes . The case sprang from a South Dakota law that would tax internet sales, as well as the state's lawsuit against online retailers such as Wayfair and Overstock.com. 
The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that states couldn't collect sales taxes gathered by mail-order catalog companies unless the firms had a physical presence in a state. South Dakota and several other states argue that things have changed in the era of Amazon.
The Supreme Court is expected to hear the arguments in April and could make a ruling by the end of June.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration, through Solicitor General Noel Francisco , formally backed up South Dakota in the case.
Citing online retailers' ""pervasive and continuous virtual presence"" in states, Francisco argued, ""the states have ample authority to require those retailers to collect state taxes owed by their customers.""
Trump's gripes with Amazon and its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos go beyond sales tax. He has ""wondered aloud"" about whether his administration could target Amazon with an antitrust law, a source told Axios.
The president has also repeatedly railed against the Bezos-owned Washington Post for news coverage he deems unfair. He has called the newspaper the ""Amazon Washington Post,"" even though they are separate companies.

3974,Trump trade czar Navarro: 'We might get a really good deal on NAFTA',"Trump trade czar Navarro: 'We might get a really good deal on NAFTA' Peter Navarro indicates hope for success in U.S. efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House trade advisor also defends Trump's decision to impose up to $60 billion of tariffs against China over intellectual property. ""We're hopeful there that the Chinese will work with us to basically address some of these practices,"" he says. 
Top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday indicated hope for success in U.S. efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
""It looks like we might get a really good deal on NAFTA,"" Navarro told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley ."" 
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump excluded Canada and Mexico from import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum until May 1. 
After that, the White House plans to reassess those exemptions, applying pressure in hopes of a quick resolution of talks to update the 24-year-old trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. 
On the Trump administration's separate move last week to levy tariffs of up to $60 billion against China for allegedly stealing American technology intellectual property, Navarro said the move was warranted. 
""China has engaged for a very long time in the theft of our intellectual property as well as practices like forced technology transfer,"" said Navarro, author of several books anti-China books including ""Death by China."" 
However, he said, ""We're hopeful there that the Chinese will work with us to basically address some of these practices."" show chapters 23 Mins Ago | 11:24 
Unfair trade practices detailed by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative accuse China of using ""joint venture requirements, foreign investment restrictions, and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure technology transfers from American companies."" 
Earlier Monday, Kevin Hassett , chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC that Trump's punitive measures on China as well as the steel and aluminum tariffs are ""designed to move us toward negotiations"" to even the playing field for global trade. 
After Trump's China tariffs announcement on Thursday, Beijing unveiled plans for reciprocal tariffs of $3 billion on 128 U.S. products. 
However, two developments since then signal hope that the U.S. and China might be able to avoid a trade war. 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday said China and the U.S. should maintain negotiations . The day before, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told ""Fox News Sunday"" he's optimistic a trade agreement will eventually be negotiated with China. 
Navarro, along with now-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , have advocated for tough measures against ""unfair trade practices"" by China and other nations. In a 2016 white paper , Navarro and Ross, a former Wall Street investor, accused Chinese leaders of ""exploiting American weakness by cheating in the trade arena."" 
Before joining with Trump, Navarro was a business professor at the University of California, Irvine, for more than 20 years. He got his doctorate in economics from Harvard.

417,Chinese e-commerce giant JD is considering a dual listing for its logistics business,"China's second-largest e-commerce firm, JD.com , could take its logistics business public and it may consider a dual listing, the company's chief said this week.
Speaking to CNBC in Davos, Switzerland at the annual World Economic Forum meeting, JD Founder and CEO Richard Liu said considerations were being made for the subsidiary business to potentially list in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
""First of all, we didn't decide which country we should list,"" Liu said. Because JD's main company is listed on the Nasdaq, he indicated that a dual listing could potentially occur in either Hong Kong or mainland China.
Dual listing refers to when a company puts its shares on multiple stock exchanges. It gives investors more flexibility and makes the stock more liquid.
JD.com listed American depository shares in its group company on the Nasdaq in 2014.
JD.com has kicked off a fundraising round at its logistics business with a target of at least $2 billion, Reuters reported this month, citing people familiar with the matter. The news wire said that Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital China would likely be lead investors in the round.
There were plans to take the business public in an overseas market, according to Reuters, which added that it wasn't clear when and where the initial public offering process would happen. Currently, JD.com fully owns the logistics business.
When CNBC asked if Liu could offer a hint about whether the logistics unit could go public this year, he answered: ""Yes, maybe, but not today.""
Last year, JD.com spun off its finance arm for more than $2 billion, and Liu acquired a 4.3 percent stake in the company.
In September, Liu told CNBC's ""Managing Asia"" that one of the reasons that business was spun off was because of a desire to expand further into the payments business — the move was similar to how JD.com's rival Alibaba spun off its payments arm Ant Financial. He also acknowledged then that the move could pave the way for a future public listing for JD Finance, but added that there was no rush to do so immediately.

* Fed's Powell assesses U.S. economy not overheating 
* Fed's Dudley says four rate hikes in 2018 would be ""gradual"" 
* U.S. core consumer inflation posts biggest rise in a year 
* U.S. 10-year yield touches 2-week low, 2-year below 9-year peak 
(Updates market action, adds quote) NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Thursday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told U.S. lawmakers that, while the economy was doing well, there was scant evidence it was overheating or propelling wages decisively stronger. The yield curve steepened a touch as Powell's latest comments reduced bets the Fed was ready to ratchet up key borrowing costs faster in the wake of last year's major tax overhaul, along with signs of inflation perking up. ""There is no evidence the economy is overheating,"" Powell said before the Senate Banking Committee. His comments, the second part of his inaugural testimony before Congress as Fed chief, were seen as less upbeat than his remarks on the U.S. economy before the House Financial Services Committee two days earlier. ""They seemed more even-keel. He's a little less upbeat, but he's still upbeat,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. His remarks before the House panel on Tuesday had sparked worries the Fed may quicken its pace of interest rate increases. Bets have grown that the Fed may raise short-term rates four times in 2018, one more than policy makers projected in December. At 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was 2.848 percent, down 2 basis points from late on Wednesday. It fell to a two-week low of 2.824 percent earlier on Thursday, Reuters data showed. The two-year yield fell to 2.250 percent after hitting a more than nine-year high of 2.286 percent on Wednesday. The spread between five-year and 30-year yields was 50.1 basis points, wider than the 48.2 basis points late on Wednesday, Tradeweb data showed. Two days of sharp losses on Wall Street and disappointing housing and regional data had raised speculation that Powell might soften his tone at his Senate appearance, in a bid to quell rate-hike jitters. As Powell was testifying, New York Fed President William Dudley, speaking in Sao Paulo, said four rate increases in 2018 would still constitute a ""gradual"" tightening. On the data front, the Commerce Department said U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months. That bolstered views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Labor Department said first-time filing for unemployment benefits fell to a 48-year low last week, while the Institute for Supply Management said its barometer on national factory activity reached its strongest level since May 2004.

CHICAGO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A new U.S. farm bill reflecting the budget goals of the Trump administration should provide crop insurance products that let farmers withstand economic slumps and also cut out waste in nutrition assistance programs, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Wednesday. 
USDA issued a broad set of principles it would like to see in the farm bill, which is written by Congress. The agency said some of its other priorities for the bill include encouraging younger farmers as well as opening up foreign markets for U.S. agricultural products. 
""These principles will be used as a road map they are our way of letting Congress know what we've heard from the hard-working men and women of American agriculture,"" U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. 
The current farm bill, which was projected to cost $489 billion over its five-year life, is set to expire this year. (Reporting by Mark Weinraub; Editing by Paul Simao)",2018-01-24T18:15:00.000+02:00
7299,USDA predicts record soybean exports despite China trade dispute,"USDA predicts record soybean exports despite China trade dispute Mark Weinraub Published 12 Hours Ago Reuters
CHICAGO, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean exports will beak a record in the upcoming marketing year despite the growing threat of a trade war with top-buyer China, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday, but traders expressed doubts about that forecast.
Skeptics noted that heated rhetoric between the United States and China, the world's top buyer of the oilseed, has sent tremors throughout futures markets in recent months and disrupted trade flows of products ranging from steel to sorghum.
Still, the USDA forecast in a monthly report that U.S. soybean exports in the 2018/19 marketing year would rise 10.9 percent to 2.29 billion bushels, adding that competition from South America will be limited this fall.
Just a month ago, Beijing proposed to slap tariffs of 25 percent on all U.S. shipments of the oilseed.
The USDA bases projections on current government policy and does not factor in potential tariffs or other trade actions yet to be implemented.
""It is interesting for (USDA) to post that high of a number in the face of the China trouble that hasn't been resolved,"" said Ted Seifried, analyst with Zaner Ag Hedge.
The forecast came the day China's agriculture ministry predicted the country will cut soybean imports for the first time in 15 years due to trade tensions with the United States.
Doubts about the USDA's projection helped pull Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures from a peak they hit after the agency released estimates for tighter supplies. The most-active contract reached a session high of $10.33-3/4 a bushel before eventually settling up 5-1/2 cents at $10.21-1/4 a bushel.
""They are really strong on soybean exports and I am very skeptical of that,"" Seifried said about the USDA.
The USDA report did not break out expected destinations for exports. The agency did raise its forecast for China's soybean imports by 6.2 percent, or 6 million tonnes, to 103 million tonnes in 2018/19, nearly matching government expectations for the increase in U.S. soybean exports.
""U.S. soybean exports projected to increase a large 225 million bushels might be flat out just wrong,"" Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst at Futures International,"" said in a note to clients. ""USDA either remains very optimistic on China trade relations and/or bullish Asian demand for soybean consumption.""
China, which needs soybeans to boost pork production amid surging domestic demand, was expected to account for about 65 percent of global soybean imports in 2018/19.
Beijing has recently stepped up checks on imports of other U.S. commodities including fruit, logs and pork. (Additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago. Editing by Tom Polansek in Chicago.)",2018-05-10T23:17:00.000+03:00
4185,"Disney announces strategic reorganization, effective immediately","Disney announced a strategic reorganization Wednesday that highlights the company's growth initiatives like direct-to-consumer offerings.
Effective immediately, Disney now has a new business segment, direct-to-consumer and international. This group includes both the technology and platforms involved in the company's streaming endeavors, as well as the distribution of those services and offerings.
It includes Disney's existing stake in Hulu as well as soon-to-be launched products like ESPN+ and a Disney-branded streaming service.
Also, the consumer products and interactive media segment will now be part of the parks and resort business.
Disney said it will begin reporting its financial statements under this new structure by the beginning of fiscal 2019.
CEO Bob Iger said in a statement that the move better positions the company for the future. He said the reorganization will help Disney ""deliver the entertainment and sports content consumers around the world want most, with more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before.""
As part of that shuffle, the entertainment giant named Kevin Mayer as chairman of its new direct-to-consumer and international business segment. Mayer has been Disney's chief strategy officer since 2015.
The announcement comes as Disney beefs up its digital platforms amid industry concerns about cord-cutting and the decline of traditional paid TV. In recent earnings calls, Iger has touted the company's streaming initiatives.
In February, he told analysts that he believes that Disney's streaming service will be able to compete with Netflix . Iger said the company's advantage is that it already has the rights to valuable franchises like ""Star Wars"" as well as content produced by box-office powerhouses like Pixar and Marvel.

Kevin Mayer Named Chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and International Segment
Bob Chapek Named Chairman of Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products Segment
BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To capitalize on today's rapidly changing media landscape and more closely align with the Company's priorities for future growth--including creating high-quality content, technological innovation, global expansion and direct-to-consumer distribution--The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced a strategic reorganization of its businesses into four segments: the newly-formed Direct-to-Consumer and International; the combined Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products; Media Networks; and Studio Entertainment. The reorganization is effective immediately.
""We are strategically positioning our businesses for the future, creating a more effective, global framework to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximize shareholder value,"" said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. ""With our unparalleled Studio and Media Networks serving as content engines for the Company, we are combining the management of our direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, technology and international operations to deliver the entertainment and sports content consumers around the world want most, with more choice, personalization and convenience than ever before.""
Kevin Mayer, who has served as Disney's Chief Strategy Officer since 2015, has been named Chairman of the new Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment. ""Kevin is a proven leader who has played a critical role in bringing together the collection of creative and technological assets that will allow Disney to offer unparalleled entertainment experiences in a direct-to-consumer future,"" Mr. Iger said. Mr. Mayer will continue to report directly to Mr. Iger.
""In addition, we are merging our Consumer Products and Parks operations under one segment, combining strategy and resources to produce even more compelling products and experiences that bring our stories and characters to life for consumers,"" Mr. Iger said.
Bob Chapek, Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, will assume additional responsibility for all of Disney's consumer products operations globally, including licensing and Disney stores, as Chairman of the new Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products business segment. ""Bob comes to this new role with an impressive record of success at both Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products, and he is the perfect leader to run these combined teams,"" Mr. Iger said. Mr. Chapek will continue to report directly to Mr. Iger.
DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AND INTERNATIONAL
The newly created Direct-to-Consumer and International segment will serve as a global, multiplatform media, technology and distribution organization for world-class content created by Disney's Studio Entertainment and Media Networks groups. The new segment will be comprised of Disney's international media businesses and the Company's direct-to-consumer businesses globally--including the upcoming Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service, the Company's ownership stake in Hulu, and its soon-to-be-launched ESPN+ streaming service, programmed in partnership with ESPN.
The Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service, which will launch in late 2019 and has yet to be named, will be the exclusive home for subscription video-on-demand viewing of the newest live-action and animated movies in the Pay TV window from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. It will also feature an impressive array of original and exclusive series and movie programming, along with thousands of titles from the Disney film and television libraries. Senior Vice President Agnes Chu will move to the Direct-to-Consumer and International segment and will continue to oversee programming for the upcoming Disney-branded streaming service.
BAMTECH, which is headed by Michael Paull, is developing both the Disney-branded and ESPN+ streaming platforms and will now house all consumer-facing digital technology and products across the Company as part of the Direct-to-Consumer and International segment. This center of excellence for technology and data platforms within the Direct-to-Consumer and International segment will provide the Company not only with increased quality and efficiencies, but also greater consumer insights that will allow for more personalization and substantially improved user experiences.
Management of global advertising sales for Disney's media properties--including ESPN, ABC, Freeform and the Disney Channels--will move from Media Networks to the new Direct-to-Consumer and International segment, giving advertisers a one-stop-shop for reaching audiences across all of Disney's media properties, including its online and direct-to-consumer platforms. Rita Ferro, President, Advertising Sales, Disney|ABC Television Group, and Edward Erhardt, President, Global Sales & Marketing, ESPN, will now report directly to Mr. Mayer. Advertising technology operations across the Company's media properties will also be managed under the new segment.
In addition, to more closely align with the Company's direct-to-consumer initiatives, the Company's program-sales operations headed by Janice Marinelli--including global distribution of film and television content to the Disney-branded direct-to-consumer streaming service, Hulu and other third-party platforms and channels, as well as Movies Anywhere--will be integrated into the Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment. Ms. Marinelli will report directly to Mr. Mayer.
The Company's International Channels--including the international Disney Channels--will also be consolidated into the new business segment. Disney's International Channels are renowned for providing incomparable branded entertainment programming that is both universally appealing and locally relevant, and the production of localized content will continue to grow under the new structure.
The new Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment will also be responsible for the distribution of all direct-to-consumer services globally.
The Walt Disney International team of regional managers across EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), Asia and Latin America will now report to Mr. Mayer.
During Mr. Mayer's tenure at Disney, he has overseen the Company's key strategic acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and most recently, its pending deal for 21st Century Fox. Prior to becoming Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Mr. Mayer served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development.
""I want to thank Bob for giving me the opportunity to lead the talented teams who, through the power of new technology and innovation, are creating the future of entertainment viewing,"" Mr. Mayer said. ""Delivering our great stories and characters directly to consumers on all high-quality devices around the world will provide the Company with meaningful new revenue streams and opportunities for growth.""
PARKS, EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS
The new Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products segment will become the hub where Disney's stories, characters and franchises come to life. Disney's worldwide consumer products business will be merged with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts under Mr. Chapek. Disney's global consumer products operations include the world's leading licensing business across toys, apparel, home goods, and digital games and apps; the world's largest children's publisher; Disney store locations around the world; and the shopDisney e-commerce platform. By uniting Disney's consumer products business and Disney Parks' robust retail and e-commerce operations, the Company will be able to share resources and best practices to provide consumers with incomparable branded products and retail experiences that only Disney can create.
Mr. Chapek has served as Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, since 2015, overseeing the Company's iconic travel and leisure businesses, which include six resort destinations in the U.S., Europe and Asia; Disney Cruise Line; Disney Vacation Club; and Adventures by Disney. Prior to that, he was President of Disney Consumer Products, where he refocused the business on a brand- and franchise-driven strategy while launching new products and retail experiences that combine technological innovation and creativity.
""Having worked with the exceptional teams at both Parks and Resorts and Consumer Products, I know this combination of incredible skills and resources will lead to a whole host of new creative ideas for high-quality products and experiences to delight our guests,"" Mr. Chapek said.
MEDIA NETWORKS
The Disney Media Networks business segment is co-chaired by Ben Sherwood, President, Disney|ABC Television Group, and James Pitaro, who was recently named President of ESPN and previously served as Chairman, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. The Media Networks segment will remain virtually the same, with the exception of the international Disney Channel operations that are moving to the Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment along with management of global advertising sales/technology.
STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT
The Studio Entertainment business segment is led by Alan F. Horn, Chairman, The Walt Disney Studios, and remains virtually the same, with the exception of the management of program sales moving to the Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment.

2896,A look inside one swag bag sent to some Oscar nominees,"Regardless of who wins the Oscar, no nominee will walk away empty handed. 
Increasingly, the Academy Awards is a chance for brands and their marketers to catch the eye of A-listers and everyday Americans alike by gifting stuff. That might explain why this year's swag bags furnished by Distinctive Assets offer a particularly wide assortment of goods.
Indeed, there are the ultra-luxe travel packages (12 nights in Tanzania with a private safari, a week in Hawaii and a beachfront villa in Greece), as well as spa treatments, skincare and herbal tea.
But if pampering is a theme, so is anxiety. Also included are underarm sweat patches, pepper spray and a golden gift certificate good for a session with a ""phobia relief expert.""
And then there are a few items that defy categorization, like an original commissioned work of art valued at $10,000, a storage tote and a ""wearable"" water bottle (it fits on your forearm like a sleeve).
show chapters Here's why 2018 looks like a boom time for billionaires      7:32 AM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 | 01:27 Altogether, the ""Everyone Wins"" gift bags are valued at over ""six-figures"" although Distinctive Assets declined to say exactly how much (however, the trip for two to Tanzania is worth $40,000 alone, the company said).
They are sent to all 25 Oscar nominees in the acting and directing categories in the week leading up to the big night and, yes, celebrities are taxed on the fair market value of what they use or redeem. ( Want to get a jump start on your filing? Here's how. )
This year's nominees include Meryl Streep, Margot Robbie, Denzel Washington, Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, among others.
For the chance to land in those celebrity hands, the participating companies, including 23andMe, Hydroxycut, Jarritos Mexican soda and Posh Pretzels, donate the goods in addition to paying a pricey promotional fee, which starts at $4,000.
In return, the contributors get ""bragging rights,"" said Distinctive Assets founder Lash Fary. ""To have their brands associated with the most buzzed about people in the world is potentially priceless.""
And if Meryl Streep doesn't want the diamond necklace or DNA kit, she is welcome to pass it along, Fary said. ""We are fans of regifting as well.""
Jeff Kravitz | FilmMagic Actress Meryl Streep poses in the press room at the 84th Annual Academy Awards. To be clear, there is no direct connection with the swag and the Academy Awards. The Oscars, in fact, filed a complaint against Distinctive Assets in 2016 for promoting the impression that the gift bags were affiliated with the awards show. ""The Academy has no affiliation, connection, or association with Distinctive Assets' ""gift bags"" or their contents, and certainly does not sponsor, endorse, or approve of Distinctive Assets, its services, or the products it promotes,"" it said in the suit.
Still, the swag continues — now in its 16 th year — with a disclaimer that says ""the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences does not award, sponsor, endorse, or provide these gift bags.""

753,Here's why the government is on the verge of shutting down,"SHARES Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) returns to the U.S. Capitol after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on the looming threat of a federal government shutdown January 19, 2018 in Washington, DC. 
The federal government shut down late Friday , largely because of some senators' exasperation with short-term measures to keep the government funded, as well as a desire to enshrine soon-to-expire protections for people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. 
The Republican-led House of Representatives on Thursday passed a four-week continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Feb. 16, but it did so with the support of nearly the whole GOP caucus and only bare minimum backing from Democrats. The measure met its fate in the Senate late Friday, as the clock ran out on a short-term measure to keep the government open. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell late Friday failed to garner the 60 votes he needed to advance the House bill to a vote on the floor of the Senate. Some Democrats, such as Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, whose states supported President Donald Trump in 2016, supported ending debate and moving on to a vote on the measure itself. Yet several Republicans – including Utah's Mike Lee and Arizona's Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic – opposed it. 
The failure to pass a bill set off a round of finger-pointing among both parties. Early Saturday, the president branded his opponents as ""losers"" intent on handing him a defeat on the anniversary of his inauguration . 
Republicans, from Trump to House Speaker Paul Ryan, have attempted to saddle Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Democratic colleagues with the blame for a potential shutdown, accusing them of brinksmanship over protections for immigrants. 
The GOP added a six-year reauthorization of the popular Children's Health Insurance Program to the funding plan to put more pressure on Democrats, framing their decision as a choice of whether to support the program. At least one Democratic senator — newly elected Doug Jones of Alabama — cited CHIP funding in a decision to back the spending bill. 
Yet Democrats aren't the only thorns in McConnell's side. Fellow Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has insisted he would not vote for another short-term funding extension. In a candid interview with MSNBC on Friday , Graham said that passing the 30-day House bill would extend ""chaos."" Later Friday, however, he released a statement that said he would support a stopgap measure that would keep the government open until Feb. 8 – more than a week less than the four-week bill passed by the House. 
Graham has also emerged as an ally for Democrats on saving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which Trump has set to expire March 5. Last week, Graham thought he had a chance for bipartisan deal to preserve DACA and enact other immigration reforms, but he said Trump's position changed swiftly. 
""He spoke compassionately about immigration, tough on security, wanted bipartisanship. Two days later, there was a major change,"" Graham told MSNBC. 
Graham, who voted against advancing the House bill late Friday night, said in an earlier tweet that he was glad Trump and Schumer met to work on an agreement – and that he is confident Trump would end up sealing a deal.",2018-01-20T04:10:00.000+02:00
2546,"The worst of the bond rout is yet to come, says Piper Jaffray","show chapters Rising rates slam stocks as market volatility rages on 22 Hours Ago | 04:31 It all started with bond yields.
Spiking yields spilled over onto the stock market in the past week, first triggering a nearly 666-point drop on the Dow last Friday and then sparking two declines of more than 1,000 points within just 4 days.
The bond rout will continue with yields on the 10-year possibly reaching 3 percent in the near term, according to Craig Johnson, senior technical strategist at Piper Jaffray. That is a level it has not reached since January 2014.
""This is a 36-year reversal in rates,"" Johnson told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Thursday. Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have generally been in decline over the past 3 decades, indicating a long-term bull market for bond prices.
""When you reverse that downtrend from down to up you typically get a momentum response and a quick move up. That's exactly what you're seeing in the bond market right now,"" added Johnson. ""You've got to be careful in here right now.""
The yield on 10-year Treasurys has risen at a fast clip since the U.S. election in November 2016. Bond yields held at around 1.8 percent prior to the election and have since moved up 100 basis points to hit a 4-year high of 2.86 percent this week.
The uncertainty of a Trump presidency initially sent bond prices lower and yields higher at the end of 2016. Now, worries over the effect an accelerating economy and rising inflation might have on Federal Reserve policy this year have taken over. Historically, bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
""A lot of what pushed this initially was inflation. Inflation fears, inflation concerns,"" said Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global.
Average hourly earnings in December rose at their fastest pace since 2009, increasing expectations that the central bank might need to raise the federal funds rate faster than it had planned to prevent inflation from overheating. Add the possible benefits of the tax reform package to the mix, and the Fed could need to raise rates as many as four times this year. The first rate increase of the year is expected at the March meeting, according to CME Group.
Sanchez does not see overinflation as a major concern to the economy at the moment. Wage growth has returned, but just barely, she said. The ballooning U.S. deficit is more troubling, especially after the House and Senate passed a spending bill that dramatically increases U.S. debt.
""That is probably a bad idea at this point in the cycle,"" said Sanchez. ""It puts the U.S. in a more unsustainable position.""
Congress passed a budget deal early Friday that will fund the federal government through March 23, allowing the House and Senate more time to craft a full-year budget. The legislation also extends the authority to borrow through March 2019 which takes the threat of a shutdown off the table for the rest of the year.
Fiscal conservatives balked at the bill's cost. The legislation would increase the U.S. deficit by around $320 billion, pushing the annual deficit to $1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The substantial increase could put pressure on the government-backed fixed-income market.
The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds traded at 2.84 percent on Friday morning. The 30-year Treasury yield was largely flat at 3.14 percent.

3969,Blue Apron is heading to the grocery store as customer retention remains elusive,"Blue Apron is coming out of its box and onto grocery store shelves.
The meal kit company, which has struggled to hold onto customers amid growing competition and distribution issues, is set to bring its meals to supermarkets sometime this year, Blue Apron confirmed Thursday.
""This offering is part of our strategy to leverage the strength of our brand and the quality of our product to expand to new channels and new consumer segments,"" a company spokeswoman told CNBC. 
Blue Apron has been struggling to overcome well-publicized operational issues that have dragged its stock down more than 78 percent since it started trading in late June.
Shares of the company were up about 2 percent on Thursday.
The company has been slimming down its marketing budget in an effort to turn profitable, but in doing so, its customer acquisition has slowed. 
In the fourth quarter, the company said the number of customers fell 15 percent from a year earlier and fell 13 percent from the prior quarter.
Blue Apron started testing the waters in offering specialized programs and diets as a way to lure customers. In January, it started selling a Whole30 meal plan. The 30-day diet plan, which was available through Feb. 26, focused on ""whole"" foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables and eliminated items like sugar, alcohol, grains, soy and dairy.
In addition, the company has begun to offer flexible plans and recipes. It has introduced meals that could be made within 30 minutes, meals that require less cleanup and brought back customers' favorite recipes.
Entering grocery stores is the next step. 
""This new multichannel offering, which will make our brand more accessible to homes across the country,"" the Blue Apron spokeswoman said. 
Blue Apron has been pressured by a growing number of competitors in the meal kit industry as well as the grocery space.
Meal kit companies like Marley Spoon and Sun Basket have capitalized on consumers' desire for cheaper meals and more choice; grocers like Albertsons and Kroger have acquired smaller meal kit services to bring into their stores; and Walmart and Amazon announced plans to bring meal kits to supermarkets.
Even Weight Watchers is jumping into the fray. The company announced plans last week for a line of quick prep meal kits at grocery stores.",2018-03-15T16:13:00.000+02:00
3373,Zuckerberg has sold more Facebook stock in the last 3 months than any insider at any other company,"In the two weeks before Facebook 's latest struggles, CEO Mark Zuckerberg sold 1.14 million shares as part of regularly scheduled programs.
That was the most insider selling for any public company, going back as far as three months, according to Argus Research's Vickers Weekly Insider. 
In the Facebook case, Zuckerberg and another executive sold shares about $20 above where they were trading Tuesday. 
Analysts are not suggesting anything nefarious behind the regularly scheduled sales. However, the sheer volume of the selling can amount to an overhang on the stock at a time when it could use all the support it can get.
Facebook shares dropped 6.77 percent into correction territory Monday, the first trading day after a data scandal involving 50 million accounts added to concerns about user privacy. Facebook shares traded 5.3 percent lower near $163 Tuesday afternoon. 
""The insiders use Rule 10b5-1 to sell on a regular basis. There are trading plans that they adopt and then they sell shares in a methodological manner,"" said Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore. ""I don't see a connection between the insider selling and the news that has come out in the last few days.""
Still, investors and analysts who make buying and selling decisions based on executive stock moves give these plans some weight despite the benign status companies try to assign them.
""They can cancel the plans any time they want,"" Silverman said. ""Obviously [it's] something we'll look for in the wake of what's going on and see if there's any decrease in the insider selling volume in the near term."" 
Companies often compensate executives with stock, which they can sell at their discretion or according to a scheduled plan as determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b5-1. After Facebook, the highest volume of insider selling during the last three months was at RealPage , Oritani Financial and Vonage , each selling more than half a million insider shares, according to the Vickers data.
Zuckerberg 's sales accounted for the most, by far. He announced plans in September to sell 35 million to 75 million shares over the next 18 months to fund philanthropic efforts . He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have promised to give away 99 percent of their company stake to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which has focused on disease and education.
In the last two weeks, Zuckerberg sold 228,400 shares a day on March 8 and March 9, 220,000 shares a day on March 12 and March 13, and 245,400 shares on March 14, the Vickers data showed.
That's a total of just over 1.14 million shares sold at an average price of $183.81, for a payout of nearly $210 million. As of Wednesday, Zuckerberg still held nearly 393.1 million shares, or 13.53 percent of common shares outstanding, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
However, he has seen his wealth drop to around $66 billion from $75 billion since the stock closed on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index and Forbes.
The Vickers data also showed that Facebook's Chief Technology Officer Michael Todd Schroepfer sold 38,024 shares on March 13. At the average price of $183.20, the stock sale brought in about $6,970,000.
Schroepfer has been selling every second week of the month since November 2016, said InsiderScore's Silverman. ""He's probably selling under a plan that was adopted quite a while ago.""
Facebook declined to comment about the scheduled insider selling and the share-price decline.",2018-03-20T19:42:00.000+02:00
5726,Drugstores are making it easier to empty your medicine cabinet,"It's a common problem.
Your doctor prescribes medicine, you don't use it all and don't know what to do with the extra. What you don't want to do is keep them.
To make it easier to get rid of leftover prescription drugs, CVS Health and Walgreens are installing machines for disposal in their drugstores. Consumers simply drop the unwanted medication into what looks like a mailbox.
Drug disposal programs are one way to help stem the growing opioid crisis. It may seem harmless to save leftover pain pills for a rainy day, but kids and teens can get into them. Worse, their experimentation can lead to addiction.
So many people are overdosing from heroin and synthetic opioids that the U.S. life expectancy shortened two years in a row. The Surgeon General recently urged more people to carry opioid antidote naloxone, the first advisory from a surgeon general since 2005.
The drug supply chain has come under scrutiny for its role in fueling the crisis. States and local governments have sued drugmakers and distributors, and the Trump administration has indicated it will get involved.
Pharmacies weren't allowed to take back prescriptions until 2014 when the Drug Enforcement Administration issued new regulations in response to the growing opioid epidemic. Before then, people could typically only dispose of them at police departments. Some people weren't comfortable dropping them off at police stations or just didn't know they were there.
""We know firsthand patients are looking for solutions,"" said Rick Gates, Walgreens ' senior vice president of pharmacy operations. ""We asked patients, and what we heard was bringing medications back to pharmacies felt like the right thing to do because they're the places they go to pick up their prescriptions.""
Source: Walgreens Walgreens has installed 600 drug disposal kiosks to its stores since 2016. It's partnering with AmerisourceBergen, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Pfizer and Prime Therapeutics to add 900 more. Walgreens started adding drug disposal units in 2016 and now has 600. It's collected 155 tons of medications since the program began. AmerisourceBergen , the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Pfizer and Prime Therapeutics are partnering with Walgreens to add kiosks to another 900 stores.
Stericycle , a company specializing in disposing of regulated substances like pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, removes the drugs and incinerates them. They had initially planned on emptying the kiosks once a month, but they were filling up so quickly they had to clear them once a week or once every other week in some cases, Gates said.
""We're quite excited by what we've done. Obviously our goal with experience is to continue to drive that story up about unused medications in cabinets and how do we prevent abuse,"" he said.
CVS Health is in the process of installing 750 kiosks to its stores. It's already donated more than 800 units to police departments. By June, it will have more than 1,600 in total.
Installing each unit takes time and planning to make sure it complies with regulations, said Tom Davis, CVS Health's vice president of pharmacy professional services. They must be bolted into the floor so people can't them pick up, they need to be locked at all times, and when they're emptied and sent to a disposal company they must comply with the DEA's protocols, among other requirements, he said.
""(Installing a kiosk) sounds like an easy thing to do, but when you think about all the regulatory complexity, you gotta get it right and do each one at a time,"" he said.
Permanent kiosks are still only available at a fraction of pharmacies around the country, but there are other alternatives for people looking to get rid of medications. Police departments, fire stations and some local government buildings offer them .
On April 28, the DEA will sponsor its semi-annual National Prescription Drug Take Back Day when people can bring their leftover prescription drugs to police departments, drugstores and other collection sites.
Walmart gives pharmacy customers powder called Dispose Rx that turns solid when mixed into a pill bottle with warm water, making it safe to throw it away. Rite Aid sells envelopes people can use to return their extra medications.
Some medicines are safe to flush down the toilet, according to the Food and Drug Administration . For others, the agency recommends removing them from their original containers and mixing them with something undesirable like cat litter or coffee grounds then putting them in a container like a plastic bag and throwing them away.",2018-04-15T19:44:00.000+03:00

2444,Top career US diplomat to step down in a blow to the State department,"The top career U.S. diplomat announced Thursday he will step down, dealing a blow to the State Department as the Trump administration confronts numerous international challenges.
The State Department's third-ranking official, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, informed agency staffers that he will retire as soon as a successor for his Senate-confirmed post is chosen and ready to assume the job. Shannon is a near 35-year veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service and was the most senior department official to remain in his job after the transition from the Obama to the Trump administrations. He served under six presidents of both political parties since 1984 and was widely seen as a symbol of diplomatic continuity and professionalism during the tumultuous transition last year.
In an interview, Shannon, who holds the rank of ""career ambassador"" — the highest in the foreign service — said he was retiring for personal and not political reasons. ""I decided it was an important moment to take a step back and to determine what next I can do in my life,"" Shannon said. He said the death of his mother late last year and his own 60th birthday last week contributed to his decision. But he also said he considered himself the ""designated survivor"" when former President Barack Obama tapped him for the undersecretary post in February 2016.
""Aside from helping the Obama administration to the finish line, I knew my job was also about helping this institution navigate the political transition, get across the river,"" he said. ""And, once across that river, help this institution — the foreign service and civil service — be responsive to our elected leadership.""
""I've served well across 35 years,"" Shannon continued. ""I've fought the good fight. I've lived by my oath and I want to go out living by my oath, which is respect for the Constitution, respecting our political institutions, respecting our values and respecting the choices that the American people have made.""
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , who has been criticized for his leadership of the State Department and removing or forcing out senior career officials, said he had asked Shannon to stay on and acknowledged that Shannon's departure would be a loss. ""Thirty-five years of experience is not something you replace overnight,"" he said.
Tillerson dropped by during the interview and said Shannon could return if he did not enjoy retirement.
""There will always be a place for Tom Shannon at the State Department,"" Tillerson said, adding he would miss Shannon's ""encyclopedic"" knowledge of the State Department and U.S. diplomatic history. ""He is the senior statesman.""
Tillerson's praise aside, Shannon's departure is sure to be seized on by critics of the administration who accuse Trump and Tillerson of gutting the foreign service, particularly its senior ranks. Of five ""career ambassadors"" on the job when Tillerson arrived at the State Department, only one remains and that diplomat is currently on sabbatical.
Shannon, who has extensive diplomatic experience in Africa and Latin America and led U.S. delegations to Russia last year, said he had confidence in younger foreign service officers to carry on despite today's ""hyper-politicized"" American politics.
""It would be my hope that, independent of the political forces that swirl in this town, that especially my foreign service colleagues, both present and past, will recognize the importance of honoring the profession and our ethos of service.""
Shannon said he had ""supreme confidence"" in the younger generation of foreign service officers, 60 percent of whom have been diplomats for less than 10 years.",2018-02-01T17:17:00.000+02:00
4380,"The Fed is about to get more aggressive, and 'collateral damage' may ensue","GDP outlook The Fed is about to get more aggressive, and 'collateral damage' may ensue Traders in recent days have been pricing in a higher chance of a fourth Fed interest rate this year. For the markets, the debate is why the central bank will hike — if it's to keep up with economic growth or to tamp down inflation. Market strategist Jim Paulsen thinks investors are little too sanguine about the prospects for inflation and could get burned. 6 Hours Ago | 05:38
Investors are getting more comfortable with the idea of four interest rate hikes this year, though it may not last long.
A steeper rate incline likely will come with increased inflation pressures that in turn could serve as a millstone for a market struggling to post meaningful gains even amid blockbuster corporate earnings.
Think in terms of higher consumer and producer price readings coupled with surging oil prices and a falling dollar, all combining to form a landscape that investors haven't seen in decades.
""If all that happens to make a fourth hike necessary, I'm not sure the market will be as comfortable as you see at the moment,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""It's the movement around it that shifts around your feet and makes the environment a lot more hostile.""
Following a series of readings showing that inflation is edging toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target level , traders who make bets on where the central bank is going to put its benchmark rate have indicated more hawkish expectations. As of early afternoon trading Monday, the possibility of a fourth rate hike this year — the Fed already approved one in March — was about 47 percent after reading just below 50 percent earlier in the session. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Optimists have held onto the hope that even if the Fed moves more aggressively, it will be doing so for the right reasons. That would mean strong economic growth accompanied by just a dose of inflation that would push wages higher and increase quality of life without an outsized rise in prices.
The other side is the bleak scenario, where long-dormant inflation rises and the Fed finds itself behind the curve after years of loose monetary policy. The central bank then has to move more quickly than the market anticipates, putting pressure on both stock and bond prices, which move inversely to yields.
Paulsen has been more in the latter camp, even warning that a moderate bout of 1970s-era ""stagflation,"" or low growth and high inflation, could be on the way.
""The collateral damage around that is going to be much more brutal than what people are currently thinking,"" he said. ""I don't think the Fed's thinking we're getting runaway real growth. They see the inflation evidence and are thinking it could get worse.""
The U.S. economy grew at a 2.3 percent pace in the first quarter, more than expected but still around the tepid post-recession level.
Fed policymakers had long insisted they were ""data dependent"" in their decision-making, but the most recent trajectory has looked more like a predetermined path toward normalization from the extreme accommodation that began in late 2008.
Amid this environment, investors will be looking for clues about not only how many times the Fed will be hiking, but also why.
The Federal Open Market Committee begins its two-day meeting Tuesday, with the market not expecting any change in rates but anticipating some shifts in language from the post-meeting statement that will indicate a more aggressive road ahead.
""It really depends on whether it's perceived that the Fed is ahead of the curve a little bit,"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Atlantic Trust. ""In other words, are they responding to a tiny acceleration in the inflation numbers or really reacting to rising confidence in the strength of the expansion.""
""If the fourth rate hike is viewed in that context, it's not much of a problem for the market,"" Donabedian added. ""If the inflation number starts to accelerate further it becomes more of a problem. Then the psychology becomes, uh-oh, maybe four isn't enough.""
Traders actually are pricing in a 7.5 percent chance of a fifth hike this year — minimal, but not zero. The Fed's job actually has gotten a bit easier in recent days, as the bond market has pushed yields higher on its own. Central bank policymakers, then, will be reacting as much to market dynamics as their own judgments.
Donabedian said he'll be watching Friday's nonfarm payrolls report closely for average hourly earnings growth. Should that point to aggressively higher wage pressures, it would suggest a more aggressive Fed and could pressure stock and bond prices, he said.
Forecasters at Capital Economics were one of the first to predict a fourth rate hike, and they see the case only getting stronger in recent days.
""Despite economic activity slowing in Q1, we expect the Fed to press on with three more rate hikes this year, not least because inflation has been higher than anticipated in recent months,"" Andrew Kenningham, Capital's chief global economist, said in a note.
Kenningham figures the post-meeting statement will refer to ""a steady rise in interest rates over the coming year or two"" and an acknowledgment that ""inflation has been higher than expected."" WATCH: Fed rhetoric grown more hawkish in last month show chapters ",2018-04-30T21:03:00.000+03:00
1066,Success of 'Bright' shows even Netflix's rotten movies are blockbuster hits,"Source: Netflix Will Smith in Netflix film Bright. 
Netflix's lead in the internet video streaming market is so large the company's poorly reviewed movies can do well, according to one Wall Street firm. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Netflix shares, citing the success of its movie ""Bright."" 
""Netflix ended the year with the release of major film Bright, which despite weak critic reviews, had an estimated 11mn viewers in the first three days, roughly on par with a successful blockbuster movie opening in the theaters and nearly the numbers we saw from the highly anticipated second season of Stranger Things,"" analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We expect Netflix to continue to increase spending on original content and feature films to grow subscribers, which would lead to healthy top line growth."" 
Schindler raised his price target for Netflix shares to $233 from $225, representing 10 percent upside from Monday's close. 
""Bright"" received the approval of just 27 percent of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. 
The analyst noted Netflix already announced a sequel to ""Bright,"" which means it is satisfied with the performance of its first large budget movie. He also said the movie did better viewership than the company's ""The Crown"" season 2. 
""We continue to think Netflix is in a strong position to capitalize on the shift to on demand viewing, the acceleration of cord cutting and the global demand for premium video content,"" he wrote. ""Netflix is in a unique position where it can afford to spend on acquiring and producing premium content and still have that spend be efficient given its global subscriber base.""",2018-01-09T18:58:00.000+02:00

5287,Steve Jobs had to convince Tim Cook to join Apple in 1998 — here's how he did it,"Today, Tim Cook is one of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley and the CEO of the world's most valuable company, with Apple 's market value above $870 billion. But, 20 years ago, it took a convincing sales pitch from legendary founder Steve Jobs before he agreed to take a job at Apple.
In early 1998, Jobs had just returned to Apple a year earlier after more than a decade away. The company had been on the edge of failure before his return , and the turnaround was still in its early stages — the iconic iMac had not been released (it came out later that year) and the iPod was still a few years away. So heading there wasn't the easy decision it might be today.
Recruiters for Apple had been after Cook, a vice president at Compaq, which was then the world's biggest seller of PCs worldwide. He turned them down several times, he told Charlie Rose in 2014. But then he thought, ""I'm going to go out and take the meeting. Steve created the whole industry that I'm in, I'd love to meet him.""
When the pair got together, "" Well, I'm just thinking I'm going to meet him and all of a sudden he's talking about his strategy and his vision,"" said Cook.
And Cook was impressed.
""I'd always thought that following the herd was not a good thing... He was doing something totally different,"" said Cook . For example, at the meeting, J obs described to Cook ""what later would be called the iMac.""
Cook was taken.
""The way that he talked, and the way the chemistry was in the room, it was just he and I,"" he told Charlie Rose. ""I looked at the problems Apple had, and I thought you know, I can make a contribution here. And working with him, and this is a privilege of a lifetime.
""And so all of a sudden I thought, I'm doing it. I'm going for it....""
Those around Cook balked.
""Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq,"" Cook said in a 2010 commencement speech that he delivered at his alma mater, Auburn University, a year before taking over as Apple CEO.
""One CEO I consulted felt so strongly about it he told me I would be a fool to leave Compaq for Apple.""
Cook did it anyway. Taking the job ""didn't make sense. And yet, my gut said, go for it. And I listened to my gut.""
He joined Apple in 1998 as senior vice president of worldwide operations.
show chapters How Steve Jobs transformed Apple according to one of Apple's early employees 4:27 PM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 | 01:16 In his 2010 Auburn commencement speech, Cook noted that it was pure intuition that told him to stake his career on Jobs' vision of Apple's future.
""There are times in all of our lives when a reliance on gut or intuition just seems more appropriate — when a particular course of action just feels right,"" Cook told the graduates. ""And interestingly, I've discovered it's in facing life's most important decisions that intuition seems the most indispensable to getting it right.""
Obviously, the decision served Cook well: He became Apple's chief operating officer in 2007 and even ran the company briefly in 2009 , when Jobs was on medical leave, before becoming CEO when Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer. Apple was already one of a handful of the world's biggest companies when Cook took over for Jobs and its market value is now more than 2.5 times what it was in 2011.

5387,"Asda and Sainsbury's deal is an 'Amazon protection program,' investment manager says","The merger deal between J Sainsbury and Walmart's Asda is an attempt to protect against the rise of e-commerce giant Amazon, an investment manager told CNBC on Monday.
The two companies announced early Monday that they will join forces to become the U.K.'s largest grocer , surpassing Tesco. The deal, worth about £7.3 billion ($10 billion), will keep both the Sainsbury's and Asda brands.
The combined business will generate at least £500 million ($688.62 million) in cost savings and lead to a reduction in prices of about 10 percent, the supermarkets said.
Peter Toogood, chief investment officer at Embark Group, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the deal wasn't ""the most sophisticated.""
He described the merger news as ""the Amazon protection program continues.""
Sainsbury's and Asda have struggled with their sales growths, which have weighed on their ability to obtain cheaper deals with suppliers. Both competition from online and from discounters has put pressure on the grocery market.
""It's just putting two companies together that aren't growing. So, again, it will help the margin story, but they have also just told you they are going to whack prices down by 10 percent… Tesco…, if anything, is holding their price,"" Toogood added.
show chapters Not sure Sainsbury's is doing the right thing in Asda tie-up: Investec 11 Hours Ago | 02:24 Kevin O'Byrne, chief financial officer at Sainsbury's, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that the merger ""allows us, particularly in a very competitive market online and with discounters, to give much greater value to our customers and that's very important.""

5732,"China is getting better at fracking, the technology that sparked the US natural gas boom","Chinese energy giants are making progress unlocking natural gas from shale rock formations, taking a step towards replicating the U.S. shale revolution, according to a new report.
But China's national oil companies still have plenty of ground to cover before they even approximate the level of success America's shale pioneers have achieved, reports energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.
Over the last decade, China's natural gas production has risen to 9 billion cubic meters. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that output will nearly double to 17 billion cubic meters by 2020 as Chinese energy giants fine tune advanced drilling methods tailored for their country.
""In terms of technology, the Chinese NOCs actually have built up their learning curves in a relatively short period."" -Dr. Tingyun Yang, Wood Mackenzie consultant While that's notable, it still makes China a minnow compared to the whale that is U.S. shale gas. Last year, American drillers produced 474.6 billion cubic meters of natural gas from shale rock.
Wood Mackenzie's forecast puts output far short of targets set by Beijing. The country aimed to produce 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas from shale by the turn of the decade to cut its reliance on coal.
""The simplest challenge for China to hit the 30 bcm target is the target's too high,"" Wood Mackenzie consultant Dr. Tingyun Yang told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in Asia.
Chinese oil companies would have to roughly double their activity to hit that target, and that is ""not physically feasible,"" says Yang.
Still, the drillers are developing homegrown technology and techniques that have cut the time and cost of drilling wells in China's southwestern Sichuan Basin, where a handful of projects are producing gas for Sinopec and PetroChina.
China has slashed the costs of drilling exploration wells by 40 percent from 2010 levels and reduced costs associated with commercial wells by a quarter since 2014, according to Wood Mackenzie.
STR | AFP | Getty Images A Chinese worker measures a pipeline at an offshore oil drilling platform in Qingdao, east China's Shandong province. The firm sees more room for further savings. A recent contract to complete four Sichuan region wells signed by oilfield services firm Honghua Group suggests costs could fall by another 20 percent compared to 2017 levels, according to Wood Mackenzie.
""In terms of technology, the Chinese NOCs actually have built up their learning curves in a relatively short period,"" Yang said, referring to national oil companies.
""They have explored a unique practice in China, compact well sites and hydraulic fracturing techniques that suit China's geology.""
Hydraulic fracturing is the key to unlocking oil and gas from shale formations. It involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and some chemicals into wells to create fractures in rock formations, which allow oil and gas to flow.
China faces challenges both above and below ground due to the nature of its shale resources.
The country's shale basins are mostly located in remote, mountainous regions that lack a network of pipelines and other infrastructure. All of that makes prepping well sites and shipping gas a costly endeavor. 
The Chinese shale formations themselves tend to be relatively deep. That means Chinese firms typically have to drill deeper than U.S. frackers, which raises costs and makes it tougher to maintain well integrity during drilling, Wood Mackenzie says.
The nation also lacks several things that drove the U.S. shale boom: open markets that promote competition, a network of small frackers that push innovation and locally available expertise.
As for whether a partnership with U.S. companies could turbocharge development, Yang says that sort of cooperation is certainly possible, but it's no cure-all because China's shale landscape is so different than America's.",2018-04-18T20:00:00.000+03:00

2738,"Students return, wary but hopeful, to the site of a school massacre","About 50 uniformed police officers marched into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School early Wednesday as classes resumed for the first time since 17 students and teachers were killed by an expelled classmate with an AR-15, thrusting them into the center of the nation's gun debate.
Grief counselors are on campus as well ""to provide a lot of love, a lot of understanding"" and help students ""ease back"" into their school routines, Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said.
A long line of cars circled the school and dozens of television trucks and vehicles were camped out nearby as students, parents and staff were ushered through a security cordon.
A banner ""Welcome Back Eagles"" sign covers the main entrance, and the walkway leading onto the campus was lined with flowers, photographs and other memorials to the those killed. Some of the students were returning despite severe gun wounds, but even those who weren't hit by bullets spoke of emotional trauma.
Alexis Grogan, a 15-year-old sophomore, planned to wear a Stoneman Douglas color — maroon — on the first day back to class Wednesday, plus sneakers that say ""MSD Strong, be positive, be passionate, be proud to be an eagle"" and ""2/14/18"" in honor of those who died.
She feels nervous, like it might be too soon to go on as usual without slain friends like Luke Hoyer, who sat two seats behind her in Spanish. Still, the support from her fellow students, and their fight to strengthen gun control laws have buoyed her spirits.
""I am so proud of how the kids at my school have been fighting because we all want change to happen and, as we see the progression, it really shows us that people do care and they do hear what we have to say,"" Grogan said in a text message.
The Douglas students return to school after a whirlwind of political activism that has reignited the nation's gun and school-safety debate. Douglas sophomore Charlotte Dixon said some of her friends are having a hard time returning to classes. But like Grogan, they are encouraged by the attention to gun laws their actions have brought.
""I'm so glad that people are stepping forward and talking about keeping it relevant ... because it shouldn't happen to anyone ever again,"" Dixon said.
On Tuesday, relatives of the Stoneman Douglas victims kept up the pressure in Florida's capital with emotional testimony during a legislative hearing to discuss passing a bill that would, among other things, raise the age limit to buy long guns from 18 to 21. The bill also would create a program that allows teachers who receive law-enforcement training and are deputized by the local sheriff's office to carry concealed weapons in the classroom, if also approved by the school district. The school's superintendent has spoken out firmly against that measure.
The House Appropriations Committee's 23-6 vote in favor of the bill Tuesday followed more than four hours of emotional discussion with the parents of some of the 17 killed, and nearly two weeks of activism by students on social media and in televised debates.
Gov. Rick Scott, who met with officials in Miami-Dade County on Tuesday, said at a news conference that he hopes a gun and school-safety bill is passed before Florida's annual legislative session ends on March 9. He had proposed measures that overlap with the Legislature's plan but did not include arming teachers. However, he declined to say Tuesday whether he would veto the sweeping package if it included that provision.
The Senate's version of the school-safety bill was approved by a second committee on a 13-7 vote Tuesday evening. Sen. Bill Galvano, who is designated to become the next Senate president and is ushering through the bill, said the earliest it will be considered by the full Senate is Friday.
Marion Hammer, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association and Unified Sportsmen of Florida, told the House Appropriations Committee that she supports tightening school security and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, but not the House bill's gun-ownership restrictions, which she later said would not have stopped the Parkland shooting.
""Part of what we need to do is make people understand that guns are not the problem,"" she said after the hearing. ""So passing more laws dealing with guns as a solution to a problem that exists within the enforcement of laws is just kind of silly.""
Max Schachter, father of 14-year-old victim Alex Schachter, said the bill the House committee eventually approved doesn't go far enough — but could have saved his son.
""If we would have had these measures in place, I would not have had to bury my son next to his mother a week and a half ago. ... I'm pleading for your help. I'm willing to compromise. Are you?"" he asked.
Outside the school on Tuesday, people tied poems to the chain-link fence surrounding the school, and dropped off red, heart-shaped balloons. The building where the shooting occurred was cordoned off, and people signed photographs of the fallen.
Junior Sidney Fischer, 17, was in a Holocaust history class when the shooter aimed his gun at the window and shot into the room. Two students in his classroom died. He's planning to wear swim goggles on his first day back Wednesday to honor his friend Nicholas Dworet, who was an accomplished swimmer.
""Obviously our school will never be the same, but I think once we get back into our normal routine people will shift back into a comfortable state,"" Fischer said.
He's planning to ride to school with a friend — just like they did before the shooting.
""I'm actually not too scared of going back tomorrow,"" he said. ""There is this sort of looming thought that someone will try to perform another shooting but I'm sure our school will be riddled with security.""",2018-02-28T14:55:00.000+02:00

4000,"After riding the momentum trade, tech investors take some profits","As goes tech, so goes the market.
We saw it on Tuesday. In the middle of the morning, semiconductor stocks — many of which have advanced 20 percent or more this quarter — began weakening, and the rest of the market followed suit.
The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF closed down 1.4 percent, its poorest showing since Feb. 9, during the height of the craziness around inflation and volatility worries.
What does this mean? With two weeks left in the quarter, traders are nervously eyeing hefty gains in technology stocks as it becomes increasingly clear that the market leadership is very stretched.
You can understand the concern: The S&P is up 3 percent, but technology is up more than three times as much, 10 percent this quarter.
Technology is now roughly 26 percent of the market capitalization of the S&P 500. That has attracted enormous amounts of short-term momentum money that will be quick to pile in but also quick to pile out, particularly around the end of a quarter.
It's not just semiconductors, which as a group are up 14 percent. Anything associated with social media, cloud computing or cyber security has also risen in the mid-teens in the last several weeks, based on the returns of ETFs tracking the sectors:
Q1 Market Leaders Technology: up 11 percent
Social Media ( SOCL ): up 15 percent
Semiconductors: up 14 percent
Cyber Security ( HACK ): up 14 percent
Cloud Computing ( SKYY ): up 12 percent

With earnings improving, there's nothing necessarily wrong with strong gains, but in recent weeks the gains have gone parabolic for a number of these stocks. A good way to look at this is through the Relative Strength Indicator, a short-hand way of looking at how fast stocks have been going up or down in the last two weeks.
Simply put, the RSI measures momentum on a scale of 1 to 100. Under 40 is oversold (buying opportunity), over 70 is overbought (susceptible to selling). Over 80 is stupidly overbought (warning). When you get close to 90, well, it's almost impossible to sustain that kind of upward momentum. Stocks either drop or, in a best case scenario, stop going up.
A lot of well-known stocks are in this stupidly overbought category:
Semiconductors: overbought (RSI >70 = overbought)
Micron 90
Microchip Tech 88
Lam Research 82
Xilinx 82
And a lot of well-known software names are in the same camp:
Software: overbought (RSI >70 = overbought)
Salesforce.com 86
Splunk 86
RedHat 83
ServiceNow 81
Stocks that are this overbought are susceptible to sudden bouts of profit-taking, which is exactly what happened Tuesday.
So is this the end of the tech rally? It seems unlikely. No matter the political craziness in Washington, tech has been able to outperform because of the strong fundamentals.
The key story is that the fundamental background has not changed: we have synchronized global growth and stronger earnings. The two big negatives, inflation and trade wars, both diminished last week.
In the past, when tech has led to the downside, it hasn't lasted very long.
As long as that backdrop remains strong, this still seems like healthy profit-taking.",2018-03-13T22:39:00.000+02:00

2427,China: We are a 'Near-Arctic State' and we want a 'Polar Silk Road',"China: We are a 'Near-Arctic State' and we want a 'Polar Silk Road' China's new Arctic Policy was outlined by its first official white paper, released on Jan. 26. China, which self-identified as a ""Near-Arctic State,"" sought to establish exactly how it believes the region should be governed and utilized. That's raised fears about a Chinese takeover of the region, but experts cautioned that a geopolitical standoff over the Arctic isn't necessarily coming. CNBC.com VCG | Getty Images Hu Kaihong, a spokesman of State Council Information Office, shows China's new Arctic Policy at a news conference on January 26, 2018 in Beijing, China. 
China announced its official Arctic policy to the world late last month, promoting Beijing's ambitions for the region and raising fears about a Chinese takeover of the polar zone. 
But while the world's second-largest economy, which self-identified as a ""Near-Arctic State"" in its new white paper , may have it's own economic and foreign policy interests in mind, experts cautioned that doesn't mean a geopolitical standoff is coming. 
Still, Beijing's new document does seek to establish exactly how it believes the region should be governed and utilized. 
The paper explains that China's interests in the Arctic can be narrowed down to two categories. On the one hand, Beijing is ""closely involved"" in activities in the area like scientific research, resource exploration and exploitation, shipping and security. And separately, climate change and its potential consequences on the region are expected to affect much of the world, so China is naturally concerned. ""China wants to be included in economic benefits here, that is the reason for their involvement even if they do not possess legitimate geographical reasons or logic to be considered a member of the region."" -Zhang Zhixing, senior East Asia analyst at Stratfor 
""The Arctic situation now goes beyond its original inter-Arctic States or regional nature, having a vital bearing on the interests of States outside the region and the interests of the international community as a whole, as well as on the survival, the development, and the shared future for mankind,"" the white paper said. 
Of note, China's emphasized in the white paper that countries should respect ""the rights and freedom of non-Arctic States to carry out activities in this region in accordance with the law,"" specifically pointing multiple times to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Those references to international laws, however, aren't totally congruent with Beijing's history with such rules. China's strategy 
China — which is no closer to the Arctic than Poland is — has been working on its strategy for an extended period of time, with its induction as an observer state on the Arctic Council approved in 2013. 
The Arctic policy is a consolidation of the world's second-largest economy's activities in the Arctic for the past five to 10 years, according to Zhang Zhixing, a senior East Asia analyst for geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor. 
According to the white paper, China wants to tie the Arctic to its Belt and Road Initiative , encouraging joint efforts to construct a ""Polar Silk Road"" or ""blue economic passage"" that would link China and Europe through the Arctic Ocean. 
The Belt and Road Initiative aims to connect Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa with vast logistics and transport networks. While Beijing has touted the project as a mutual economic development initiative, it's widely seen as an attempt by China to construct a massive, multi-national zone of economic and political influence that has Beijing at its core. 
The addition of the Arctic into the initiative has raised red flags for some, as the wider project is seen by some experts as an important component of China's foreign policy. 
While the Arctic hasn't always been an accessible part of Chinese policy, global warming has increased the rate of the region's ice cap melt in summer , which is raising its economic potential as a commercial maritime route in future. 
According to the World Trade Organization's 2017 statistical review , about 88 percent of global merchandise trade occurs between Asia, Europe and North America — some of which could conceivably pass through the Arctic Ocean in the future. 
""The white paper is an official statement to ensure China has a foothold in the Arctic and the activities that are ongoing,"" Zhang told CNBC. 
China wants to make sure its point of view is reflected in the region, through involvement in Arctic governance and by shaping its agenda, she said. 
""China wants to be included in economic benefits here, that is the reason for their involvement even if they do not possess legitimate geographical reasons or logic to be considered a member of the region,"" Zhang said. Mario Tama | Getty Images A glacier is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft on March 29, 2017 above Ellesmere Island, Canada. A challenge 
The crux of the issue, according to many analysts, is that the Arctic could tip the already rising tensions between the U.S. and China, but the situation may have been exaggerated, according to Zhang. 
""Many experts are pointing to the South China Sea dispute as the eventual outcome to China's Arctic involvement, but the strategic value of the Arctic simply does not make sense for China to engage in confrontational behavior,"" Zhang said. 
This is because ""even though the Arctic Circle contains large amounts of untapped resources, as well as being a potential trade route, the full potential of the Arctic to become commercially viable seems to be at least a decade away,"" the Stratfor analyst said. 
In the South China Sea, a resource-rich and strategic region where several nations have claims, China has ignored maritime law and a legally binding tribunal ruling by building islands there. ""If anything, Russia poses more of a threat in the Arctic to American interest."" -Andrew Holland, director of studies and senior fellow at the American Security Project 
Another reason why fears of dispute may be unfounded is the fact that China lacks any semblance of geographical claim in the Arctic, unlike in the South China Sea, said Andrew Holland, director of studies and senior fellow for energy and climate at non-partisan research organization American Security Project. 
""China poses a challenge, not a threat, to the U.S."" Holland said of the Arctic. ""There has not been any confrontational behavior from China, and we don't expect to see it escalate to a confrontational stance at any point."" 
""If anything, Russia poses more of a threat in the Arctic to American interest,"" Holland said. Polar partnerships 
Through the promise of investments and trade growth, China made sure to take diplomatic steps in courting the Arctic Council. 
The country entered into joint ventures with Russian gas companies , it built a large embassy in Iceland , it helped finance the Kouvola-Xi'an train in Finland, it thawed its relations with Norway and it invested into Greenland. 
The influx of investments is important to Greenland's goal to become less reliant on Denmark . In exchange, China wants access to the mines in Greenland, Holland said. 
The behavior echos the language used in the white paper, which is careful to emphasize cooperation (a word used 45 times in the English version) — allaying the international community's concerns about China's intentions in the polar region. Kirill Kudryavtsev | AFP | Getty Images A gas derrick at the village of Sabetta in the Kara Sea shore line on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic circle on April 16, 2015. 
Holland told CNBC that China is also talking about collaboration as a way to leverage its position in Arctic affairs with the promise of Belt and Road funds. 
""China is able to provide financing for Arctic countries, their activities and expeditions,"" Zhang said, adding that ""China may even act as a balance, to stop reliance on any single country and to encourage collective decision making."" 
Although Beijing may ultimately have self-interested motives, its work in the Arctic may actually prove beneficial since the Chinese are able to provide capital and joint venture opportunities to countries that lack the necessary funds, Holland said. 
Still, the U.S. should step up its investments and diplomacy efforts in the Arctic in the face of China's influence challenge, Holland said. The American Security Project expert added, however, that he did not anticipate any big response from Washington D.C., as the Arctic is not high on the priority list for the country. 
Other American foreign policy priorities he cited were Syria and the South China Sea: ""The Arctic does not hold enough strategic value, nor is the issue pressing enough to warrant a big response from the U.S."" ",2018-02-15T03:08:00.000+02:00
3746,Cramer says fears of artificial intelligence added to the market sell-off,"After the Dow Jones industrial average's 700-point plunge on Thursday, CNBC's Jim Cramer knew he had to determine the causes of the sell-off for investors.
The main issue seemed to be President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs on Chinese goods , which spooked companies that do business in the People's Republic.
While was relieved that the tariffs only targeted China and not other U.S. trading partners, he acknowledged the chief worry among investors.
""The problem is we don't know where the Chinese are going to hit back,"" he said Thursday, noting the broad spectrum of consumer- and business-facing companies operating in China.
One potential target could be the technology sector, which accounts for 26 percent of the S&P 500 , Cramer said. Chinese consumers buy a lot of U.S. technology, including but not limited to Apple products.
""Every tech company in the world ... covets China, the market, so the fears of number cuts are way too palpable for anyone to step up to the plate and buy today,"" Cramer said. ""And China's not like the U.S.; their system has few checks and balances. If President Xi wants to outright ban the sale of iPhones, he can do it.""
But tariffs aren't the only problem plaguing the tech sector at the moment. Facebook executives have been making the rounds on television to apologize for a data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a firm that reportedly harvested data from 50 million Facebook users without their permission.
As a result, ""people are becoming disenchanted with tech, particularly something they loved until recently, ... artificial intelligence,"" Cramer said. ""What Facebook did was basically allow bad guys to data mine and make judgments about people using artificial intelligence.""
That sentiment was made worse by news of a fatal accident in which an Uber-operated self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, the ""Mad Money"" host argued.
""Countless tech companies are trying to get a piece of the autonomous driving market — it's a huge opportunity,"" he said. ""But the roadside fatality we got earlier this week has slammed the brakes on the whole industry. There's going to be a lot of missed quarters here because of that accident.""
As people start to grow wary about sharing their information with big corporations, Cramer predicted continued weakness for companies on the front lines of consumer-facing big data and artificial intelligence.
""When you have Facebook saying , 'Please regulate me,' people start to worry about these things,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The bottom line? In the end, if you give us nothing to buy, we will sell. The controversies are finally coming home to roost and the sellers ... are coming right along with them. And that's how you get a hideous day like today.""

6828,"Bill George: As consumer giants struggle, Unilever rises above the pack","Zhang Peng | Getty Images Unilever's Dove bath foam, seen in a Chinese supermarket
Denise Morrison's sudden retirement as CEO of Campbell Soup highlighted the struggles that all consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are having in today's rapidly changing markets.
Except one: Unilever .
Since Paul Polman assumed the helm as CEO in January 2009, Unilever has risen above the pack with a long-term vision and consistently strong performance. In many ways, Unilever is the epitome of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi's model of ""Performance with Purpose."" As consistently strong as its performance has been the past five years under Nooyi's leadership, even PepsiCo's stock price has struggled in the last two years.
The chart below illustrates the dramatic difference in stock price performance for the consumer packaged goods giants:
In recent years CPG companies have struggled to keep pace with dramatic changes in both consumer preferences and the retail environment. On the consumer side, millennials have asserted themselves with their rejection of traditional brands in favor on smaller new brands featuring healthy and sustainable ingredients. Meanwhile, retailers have also struggled with millennials' preference for buying online as Amazon takes an ever-greater share of consumer wallets, triggering price wars and a shift to private label merchandise among big box retailers like Wal-Mart, Kroger, Safeway and Target.
What has enabled venerable Unilever to avoid these pitfalls, and come out on top? Turnaround
When Polman took over in early 2009, he inherited a moribund company with declining revenues and declining profits. Unilever then was beset with internal politics, endless reorganizations, and an aging portfolio of brands. In short, the Anglo-Dutch company had focused more on internal tug-of-wars between its British and Dutch leaders than on its customers. Polman moved quickly to globalize Unilever, setting bold goals of doubling its revenues from 40 billion Euros to 80 billion by 2020 and increasing its share of business from emerging markets to a stunning 70 percent.
In his first year, Polman introduced The Compass as Unilever's strategy for sustainable growth. It gave Unilever a clear vision, focused on winning, and elevated performance standards for its leaders. It also became a unifying force for Unilever's 175,000 employees spread across 150 countries. The following year he established Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP) as Unilever's True North, driving it through its supply chain and its products with detailed metrics. To simplify Unilever's complex organization structure and reduce internal politics, Polman simplified Unilever's complex organization structure, with four product groups and eight regions. Saumya Khandelwal | Hindustan Times | Getty Images Unilever Global CEO Paul Polman.
Polman is a strong believer in building Unilever's global leadership team. As he says, ""The only true differentiation between companies is the quality of leadership."" Most importantly, he raised the bar for Unilever leaders to be authentic and high-performing, requiring high intellectual intelligence with even higher emotional intelligence. He created the Unilever Leadership Development Plan (ULDP), putting its top 900 executives globally through a customized leadership program in cohorts of twenty leaders.
To some outsiders, Polman is an enigma. One day he is preaching the gospel of sustainability and long-term focus to CEOs at Davos. The next day he is tough-minded, demanding closed loop performance from his leaders to improve earnings. All the while, he insists on high values and ethical behavior. Better record than Buffett
Shortly after taking over Unilever, Polman met with investors in London and withdrew guidance to security analysts and quarterly earnings, telling them, ""My job is not to serve shareholders, but to serve consumers and our customers."" Of course, he believes that in doing so, Unilever will indeed serve its shareholders better over the long-term. Unilever's results in nine years back up Polman's contention: Unilever's stock value has grown 155 percent during his tenure. As he jokingly told CNBC's Jim Cramer, ""Our record is better than Warren Buffett's in this time frame.""
The joke, however, is also true.
Under Polman, Unilever has eschewed big acquisitions, the largest being the purchase of Alberto Culver. But the company has transformed its portfolio by acquiring a series of small companies that strengthened its sustainability offerings, e-commerce business, and attractiveness to the millennials. Included among them are Dollar Shave Club, Seventh Generation, Sir Kensington's, Talenti, Sundial, Living Proof, and Schmidt's Naturals.
Polman's toughest test came in February, 2017, when Brazilian investment fund 3G Capital attempted a hostile takeover through its Kraft-Heinz Company (KHC), offering $143 billion for Unilever. 3G had the backing of Warren Buffett, and had established itself as a fierce, unyielding acquirer. KHC offered a modest premium of only 18 percent and planned to shift Unilever from its growth posture to 3G's trademark ""lean and mean"" mode, employing zero-based budgeting to cut costs 30 to 40 percent to increase earnings and cash flow. As Polman noted wryly, ""You can't cut your way into prosperity or growth.""
Many analysts thought Unilever was a goner. Yet, Polman immediately swung into action, firmly rejecting the 3G offer, not even leaving the door open to negotiation for higher offers. Polman's rebuttal was so fierce that within 48 hours KHC withdrew its offer, and has shown no further signs of renewing its attack. Nevertheless, Polman committed to a complete review of ways Unilever could improve shareholder value. Six weeks later he announced a 7-point plan to enhance value that include spinning off Unilever's legacy spreads business, improving operating margins from 16 percent to 20 percent, buying back 5 billion euros of stock, cutting costs by an additional 2 billion euros, and consolidating its foods and refreshments business units into one. More recently, Unilever announced it will move its corporate headquarters from London to Rotterdam. Shareholder Beware
As attractive as takeover attempts are to short-term traders, shareholders need to be confident in the stock they are trading for. Since KHC's takeover attempt began, Unilever stock has climbed by 38 percent, while KHC's stock dropped 32 percent, as it no longer has cost cutting opportunities remaining. Had Unilever shareholders swapped their shares for KHC's, today they would be worth 50 percent less.
Why has Unilever fared so much better than its competitors? One could sight its clear vision, long-term approach, consistent performance, and a host of other factors. Instead of debating endlessly the shareholder model versus stakeholder model, it is time to recognize that shareholders are best served by companies that have a clear sense of purpose and strategy, practice consistent values, and motivate their employees to peak performance with authentic leaders at all levels – just as Unilever does.
In my opinion, everything traces to the leadership of Paul Polman for the past decade. He has succeeded in turning a moribund company into a powerhouse by staying true to his mission and his principles.
As he tweeted this week, ""A multi-stakeholder, long term responsible business model drives not only long-term value for society but equally importantly for shareholders. Focusing myopically on one or other does not get you there.""

Lexus LC 500h hybrid vehicle stands on display during the press day of the Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, South Korea, on Thursday, March 30, 2017. 
Toyota said Tuesday it will introduce Alexa, Amazon 's cloud-based voice assistant, in some Toyota and Lexus vehicles in 2018. 
The feature will be available in all Toyota and Lexus cars that have the Toyota Entune 3.0 App Suite and Lexus Enform App Suite 2.0 in 2018. 
The company will add the feature to additional models in 2019. Toyota announced the news at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
""This makes Toyota and Lexus vehicles among the first to bring the convenience of Alexa into the car and onto the road,"" said Zack Hicks, senior vice president and chief information officer at Toyota Motor North America and CEO of Toyota Connected. 
Customers will be able to access Alexa's range of skills — as its voice applications are called — while in the car. So apart from asking it some of the usual things, such as playing music or giving a weather report, passengers can also use the service to interact with smart-home devices to turn lights on in their homes or open their garage doors. Users can also ask it to identify nearby businesses in the middle of a trip and offer directions to them. 
The service will also enable new features in the cars themselves, such the ability to start the engine remotely or lock the car doors, by giving a command through another Alexa device in the home or elsewhere.",2018-01-09T21:05:00.000+02:00
851,Tell-tale signs that your partner is guilty of financial infidelity,"When financial advisor Neal Van Zutphen recently met with new prospective clients, a married couple, the meeting did not go as planned.
The process of going through their financial records prompted the husband to reveal a secret he had been keeping from his wife: $60,000 in credit card debt.
The debts had ballooned during a job transition to supplement the household's cash flow and to pay a business consultant.
""It was probably my most emotionally charged client session in 35 years,"" said Van Zutphen, president and founder of Intrinsic Wealth Counsel in Tempe, Arizona.
Keeping financial secrets from your spouse or significant other has a name: financial infidelity.
And chances are, suspicions that your partner is not being fully honest with you about money is affecting your relationship, according to a new report from CreditCards.com.
Just 52 percent of individuals polled by the website believe their significant other is honest with them when it comes to money. Meanwhile, 61 percent said they are fully honest with their partner about their finances.
And 31 percent of survey respondents said keeping credit cards and other accounts from a partner is worse than physical infidelity.
The reasons for the dishonesty around finances range from failure to communicate to straight up deceit.
Financial professionals who handle these situations regularly say there are some tell-tale signals to watch out for.
Warning signs show chapters Recognizing the signs of financial infidelity 5:58 PM ET Fri, 7 Feb 2014 First, notice when your mail no longer includes financial statements, such as credit card bills or solicitations and investment account information, said Lili Vasileff, founder and president of Divorce and Money Matters in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Next, watch out for atypical behavior. That can include lavishing you with gifts or insisting that you account for every nickel and dime, Vasileff said.
""The reason for that is their own behavior has changed and they're trying to deflect from it,"" Vasileff said.
Vasileff recalled how one husband decided the couple should downsize their home and booked a cruise so they could spend more time together.
Shortly thereafter, the wife was in a new condo and the husband walked away from the marriage. The wife ""never saw it coming,"" Vasileff said.
Also, Vasileff said to watch out for changes in habits.
""It's really true when people are having an affair that they start buying new underwear"" or going to the gym regularly, said Peggy Tracy, owner of Priority Planning in Wheaton, Illinois.
Be on the lookout for changes income or cash flow, including cash withdrawals or checks made out to cash. Tracy helped one client realize her husband had a drug problem when their financial records revealed regular withdrawals of $200 every other day.
Steps to take If you feel that you have been duped, you want to make sure you have concrete evidence, Vasileff said. That includes finding out how much money you are taking in and what is really being spent.
""There's nothing worse than having that accusation being disproved within three minutes,"" Vasileff said. Or worse, spending a lot of money to investigate where the funds have gone.
""If you're looking for $10,000 and it costs you $15,000 to find it, it's ridiculous,"" Vasileff said.
Couples can work to prevent the need from hiding their spending in the first place by sitting down to talk about money when it's not contentious, Vasileff suggested.
These plans can include setting aside an amount of money — say $10,000 each — that each individual does not have to account for.
For situations that are contentious, remember that everything leaves a paper trail, Tracy said.
""It is the truth,"" Tracy said. ""It is black and white and cannot be argued with.""
Documents helped Tracy identify hundreds of thousands of dollars one client's husband had hidden through estimated payments to the Internal Revenue Service.
The good news for the other spouse in these situations is that you generally are entitled to half of marital money that is spent on non-marital items, Tracy said.
Before it gets to that point, the best thing to do is to speak up when you first notice that something is off.
""You know in your heart what's going on,"" Tracy said. ""Either you're going to stick your head in the sand or have the courage to confront it.""

3546,French hero officer who swapped himself for hostage dies,"A French police officer who offered himself up to an Islamic extremist gunman in exchange for a hostage died of his injuries, raising the death toll in the attack to four, and the officer was honored Saturday as a national hero of ""exceptional courage and selflessness.""
Col. Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.
Beltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organized a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.
""We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,"" he said then.
But when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.
Unbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his cellphone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.
His death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.
""Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,"" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. ""In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.""
According to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France's highest honors, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.
Macron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalized.
On Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.
Lakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.
Despite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was ""no warning sign"" that Lakdim would carry out an attack.
A woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He didn't identify her.
The four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.
Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn't serious, Lefebvre said.
Lakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.
He shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" — the Arabic phrase for God is great — and said he was a ""soldier of the Islamic State"" as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.
""We heard an explosion — well, several explosions,"" shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. ""I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.""
During the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam's release wasn't a key motive for the attack.
The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group's calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.
France has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week's deadly assault in the south.

6303,Wall Street still loves Nvidia despite chipmaker’s prediction of plunging crypto-mining sales,"Analysts are optimistic over Nvidia's growth opportunities even as a key market falters.
The chipmaker reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and guidance Thursday. But the company said on the earnings conference call its second-quarter cryptocurrency-mining chip sales will likely fall by two-thirds quarter over quarter.
Nvidia's stock price fell 1.4 percent Friday.
Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating for Nvidia's stock, saying its weak digital currency business guidance is a positive and the bad news is now out there.
""Crypto is expected to decline significantly in [the second quarter]. … Management is guiding crypto revenue down 66% [quarter-over-quarter] based on feedback it has received from its enterprise-scale mining customers and conservatism given recent ETH weakness, in our view,"" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""With crypto now de-risked, in our view, and the new product launch in Gaming ahead of us, we see positive risk-reward and would thus recommend investors to Buy the stock.""
The analyst raised his price target for Nvidia to $310 from $275, representing 19 percent upside to Thursday's close.
Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards based on AMD 's and Nvidia's chips to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. In April, China-based Bitmain announced its specialized digital currency mining system for ethereum, which analysts predict could hurt demand for graphics cards.
The price of ethereum is down roughly 8 percent this year through Friday morning, according to Coinbase. The cryptocurrency is still up more than 600 percent over the past 12 months.
One Wall Street analyst told his clients to focus on Nvidia's leadership in the artificial intelligence market.
""NVDA's leadership in AI remains the most critical component of stock sentiment/valuation,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya said Thursday in a note entitled ""Best-in-class Growth + Pipeline, ignore segment noise."" ""NVDA remains the unrivaled leader in AI training, and is now gaining traction in the emerging inference TAM (5-10% of data center sales) as evidenced by the QoQ doubling in inference shipments to cloud customers in Q1.""
Vivek raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $340 from $300 and reiterated his buy rating for the company.
J.P. Morgan is bullish on Nvidia's gaming business, citing the recent launch of new popular games.
""We believe Gaming demand remains strong in the current quarter on continued blockbuster gaming titles/e-sports strength,"" analyst Harlan Sur said in a note to clients Friday. ""Demand continues to remain strong for NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1080Ti product and a strong line-up of flagship games that have recently been launched (e.g., Fortnite, PUBG, Far Cry 5, etc.), coupled with NVIDIA successfully replenishing the channel after supply tightness.""
Nvidia shares are up 34 percent so far this year through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 2 percent return.

895,"Paul Ryan: 'We want' a deal to protect young immigrants, but need more border security","SHARES Aaron P. Bernstein | Reuters Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, accompanied by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), speaks at a news conference following a closed House Republican conference meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 19, 2017. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday he seeks a deal with Democrats on protecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, but wants to see a ""good, balanced package"" that boosts border security. 
""We want to have a DACA compromise,"" Ryan said, referring to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. ""We want to make sure the DACA problem is solved. … This has to be balanced so we don't have a DACA problem five, 10 years down the road."" 
Ryan added that he wants ""the right kind of interior and border enforcement"" included in an immigration bill. His comments came shortly before bipartisan lawmakers were to meet with President Donald Trump to try to strike a deal. 
Trump has insisted on including funding to build his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in a deal , complicating the talks with Democrats, who do not want to use federal funds for the project. The Trump administration has estimated that the barrier would cost $18 billion over 10 years. 
Making matters even messier is the administration's willingness to scale back funding for ""proven security measures"" such as surveillance, radars, patrol boats and customs agents in order to fund the wall, according to The New York Times . 
Shielding those immigrants has emerged as a sticking point in negotiations to fund the government and avoid a shutdown by the Jan. 19 deadline. 
In September, Trump ended the DACA program with a six-month delay to force congressional action to pass its protections into law. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children could face deportation if lawmakers do not pass a law shielding them by March 5. 
The DACA program not only protected the immigrants from deportation but also allowed them to work in the United States. ",2018-01-09T18:07:00.000+02:00

The move came a day after the Trump administration detailed the list of Chinese imports that it aims to target with tariffs. 
Dimon said Trump's policies of tax reform and deregulation are positive for the U.S. economy and financial markets, but the president's trade policy may be a negative headwind. 
""We were very honest and he likes honesty. We told him [Trump] what we thought and it wasn't what he thought at the time,"" Dimon said.

Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters will take on Prime Ministerial duties for six weeks after the baby is born. SHARES 
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is not the first world leader to be pregnant while in office — Benazir Bhutto gave birth while she was the Prime Minister of Pakistan — but she is one of few. 
Today, Prime Minister Ardern announced that she and her partner Clarke Gayford are expecting their first child. ""We're excited and we know together that we are going to make this work and New Zealand is going to help us raise our first child,"" she told reporters. 
In an Instagram post, Ardern says that Gayford, who hosts a television show about fishing , ""will be 'first man of fishing' and stay at home dad."" A post shared by Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) on Jan 18, 2018 at 1:44pm PST 
In 2017, New Zealand Parliment voted to extend paid parental leave entitlement from 18 weeks to 22 weeks. Ardern will take only six. 
""I am by no means the first woman to multitask,"" she said. ""And in terms of being a woman in politics, there are plenty of women who carved a path and incrementally have led the way to be able to make it possible for people to look upon my time in leadership and think, 'Yes, I can do the job and be a mother.'"" 
Ardern is New Zealand's third female Prime Minister , following Jenny Shipley and Helen Clark. She told reporters that she realized she was pregnant just six days before she became Prime Minister on October, 26th 2017. 
Previously that year, when Ardern was serving as the leader of New Zealand's Labour Party, she repeatedly faced questions about her plans to have children . 
On the radio program ""The AM Show,"" former cricket player Mark Richardson said that it was a ""legitimate question"" saying that employers should have the right to know if an employee plans to have children. 
""The question is, is it OK for a PM to take maternity leave while in office?"" Richardson asked. 
Ardern said she was personally open to answering questions about her plans but said that it was inappropriate to suggest that other women should be forced to do the same. 
""For other women, it is totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace,"" Ardern said to Richardson. ""It is a women's decision about when they choose to have children. It should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job."" 
On the show, Arden said, ""I think a lot of women face this dilemma in the workplace no matter what their profession or job might be."" 
And today, Prime Minister Arden also reiterated that many women before her have done what she plans to do. ""I'm not the first woman to work and have a baby,"" she said. ""I know these are special circumstances but they'll be many women who will have done this well before I have. I acknowledge those women.""

[Update: The flight was a success. ] 
Virgin Galactic is preparing for the first powered flight of its spacecraft Unity on Thursday, CNBC has learned. 
Richard Branson's space tourism venture is going to fire the engines of its vehicle during a flight at Mojave Air and Space Port, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC. (The news was first seen by the blog Parabolic Arc.) 
Virgin Galactic has not tested a powered flight — as opposed to a glide — of one of its spaceships since the fatal crash of Spaceship Enterprise on Oct. 31, 2014. 
After extensive testing and glide tests, Virgin Galactic's CEO George Whitesides said last year the company was ""ready to go into powered flight."" With engine testing complete, Virgin Galactic completed the seventh glide test of Unity at Mojave in January. Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic Unity's seventh glide flight test in Mojave, California on Jan. 11, 2018. 
The spacecraft Unity will be dropped during flight from the much larger, jet-powered mothership Eve. A crew of two will pilot Unity in Thursday's test. Unity is expected to fire its engines for as long as 30 seconds, aiming to reach speeds of 1½ times the speed of sound or more. 
Unity is built and operated by The Spaceship Company, a subsidiary of Virgin Group. The company is also building two more spaceships, intended to become part of the fleet of Virgin crafts taking people to the edge of space. 
The original SpaceShipTwo craft was built by experimental aircraft developer Scaled Composites. In 2016, Virgin Galactic unveiled its latest version of the SpaceShipTwo design, with alterations to avoid a repeat of the accident. @VirginGalactic: Our team is prepping for a #SpaceShipTwo flight test today 
Future passengers who are willing to fork out $250,000 will be taken up with help from the spacecraft's mothership. When it reaches a certain altitude, the Virgin Galactic craft will launch into space around 68 miles above the Earth's surface, before re-entering the planet's atmosphere. 
Branson's space companies also recently got a boost from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , which announced intentions to invest $1 billion in Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit. At the time of the announcement, Branson lauded Virgin Galactic was near its intended goal.

LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures turned lower on Thursday, retreating from a six-month peak as a short-covering rally ran out of steam, while soybean and corn prices edged higher ahead of a U.S. Department of Agriculture report due later in the day. 
Dealers said the recent run-up in wheat prices had also been driven by U.S. crop concerns, though overall global supplies remained ample. 
The most activce Chicago Board of Trade wheat contract was 0.8 percent down at $4.57 a bushel at 1200 GMT, having earlier marked its highest since Aug. 8 at $4.64-1/2.

The entrepreneur announced Sunday that his tunneling firm had started selling flamethrowers. The devices were available for pre-order at a price of $500 each, and customers were also able to buy an ""overpriced"" fire extinguisher with a ""cool sticker"" for $30.
By Monday, the company had sold $3.5 million worth of flamethrowers . Musk's idea to start selling them followed The Boring Company's unusually successful run selling hats . He said last month that, if the company sold 50,000 hats, it would start selling flamethrowers.
The Boring Company's new product officially sold out Thursday, Musk said on Twitter. That means Musk's infrastructure firm has now sold $10 million worth of the devices.
Tweet
The flamethrower starts shipping in the spring, according to The Boring Company's website . Musk added on Twitter that the flamethrowers would ship with a ""complimentary Boring fire extinguisher.""
The billionaire, who is also the CEO of car manufacturer Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, posted a video to his Instagram account Sunday where he was seen wielding one of the devices and charging toward the person filming him.
Don’t do this. Also, I want to be clear that a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one. Unless you like fun.

3730,Longfin loses a third of its value after the controversial cryptocurrency stock is booted from the Russell 2000,"Shares of Longfin plunged for a second-straight day after FTSE Russell said it would remove the stock of the small, cryptocurrency play from the benchmark Russell indexes.
Longfin (Ticker: LFIN) traded 37 percent lower Tuesday near $37.31 as of 2:20 p.m. ET. The little-known stock fell 16.6 percent Monday after noted short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research tweeted that Longfin ""is a pure stock scheme."" 
The tiny stock had skyrocketed in December after news it was acquiring a firm focused on the same blockchain technology as bitcoin . Longfin went public in mid-December and announced last week it was added to the small-cap Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes on March 16 as part of FTSE Russell's quarterly additions.
However, FTSE Russell said in a release after Monday's market close that Longfin shares will be removed from the Russell Indexes due to insufficient free-floating shares as of Feb. 14. The change is set to take effect after the close Wednesday and will include the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes. 

""We are reapplying"" for inclusion in the indexes, Longfin CEO Venkat Meenavalli told CNBC in a phone interview Tuesday. He said the stock's free float has increased above the minimum 5 percent as of March 11 due to the expiration of a lockup period on a consultant's stock holdings. 
As for Citron's negative view, ""we are going to take legal action after we file the 10-K"" in the next three days, Meenavalli said. ""The company is a profitable company, making revenue.""

BJ's move to list itself comes as the U.S. retail industry is undergoing a massive transformation, due to the increasing shift of consumer dollars being spent online.
Warehouse club operators, however, have largely bucked the downturn as their business models rely mainly on recurring membership revenues rather than just topline sales.
The company, which was taken private in 2011 for $2.8 billion in cash by private equity firms Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital Partners , will list under the symbol ""BJ"", a regulatory filing showed.
The Wall Street Journal reported in April that the company could be valued between $2 billion and $3 billion, with its private-equity backers raising at least $400 million.
The preliminary filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell or their expected price.
Founded in 1984, the company owns 215 warehouse clubs, mainly on the U.S. east coast, and competes with Walmart Inc's Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale Corp.
BJ's said it generated net income of $50 million on total sales of $12.8 billion for fiscal 2017.",2018-05-17T18:07:00.000+03:00
5877,Watch SpaceX launch NASA's planet hunting satellite on a Falcon 9 rocket,"[The stream is slated to start at 6:30 p.m. ET. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]
SpaceX is set to launch Wednesday evening from Florida in its latest mission for NASA, launching a new planet-hunting satellite into orbit around the Earth.
Elon Musk's rocket company will livestream the 6:51 p.m. ET launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Delayed multiple times from March, the company's mission to launch the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (or TESS) for NASA is now ready.
The mission will launch using a Falcon 9 rocket, which will return to land on the SpaceX autonomous ship in the Atlantic Ocean about 8 minutes after liftoff.
@SpaceX: All systems and weather are go for Falcon 9's launch of @NASA_TESS today at 6:51 p.m. EDT, or 22:51 UTC. http://spacex.com/webcast
Nicknamed ""the planet hunter,"" the $337 million TESS will deploy into its first orbit just under an hour after launch, when SpaceX's part of the mission will be complete. TESS will then use a series of complex maneuvers to head into a never-before-used orbit, reaching about 232,000 miles beyond the Earth, to photograph the skies.
At only 800 pounds, TESS is a fraction of the weight Falcon 9 can lift into orbit. NASA gave SpaceX the contract to launch TESS into orbit above the Earth at a cost of $87 million.
While the Falcon 9's lower stage is expected to land, SpaceX will likely not be attempting to recover the rocket's upper stage on this mission, as that part of the rocket is not expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. Musk floated an idea for upper stage recovery in a series of tweets recently, saying his company would bring Falcon 9's upper stage ""back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon.""

Tesla is being probed by a California agency for occupational safety after a report that the electric carmaker failed to disclose serious injuries at a Fremont factory. 
The state's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) disclosed the inspection on Wednesday, two days after news website Reveal said that Tesla's omissions in legally mandated reports made its safety record appear better than it was. 
The probe began on Tuesday, Erika Monterroza, spokesperson for Cal/OSHA, said. The agency typically reviews an employer's log of work-related injuries and illnesses to make sure that serious injuries are reported directly to the administration within eight hours, she added. 
A Tesla spokesman said Cal-OSHA is required to investigate any claims, whether they have merit or are baseless. 
""We have never in the entire history of our company received a violation for inaccurate or incomplete injury record-keeping,"" he said in an emailed statement.

7191,"Charts are pointing to a relief rally for bonds, says trader","1 Hour Ago | 04:22
The bond market is about to breathe a sigh of relief, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday.
Looking at a chart of the ETF that tracks longer-term Treasurys, Gordon said the bond market is oversold as yields remain overbought. He expects a relief rally around the corner. Here's why:
• Gordon observes that the 20+ Year Treasury ETF ( TLT ) has just completed the fifth wave of the Elliott wave theory, which according to him usually indicates that the trend momentum is about to decrease.
• Given TLT was generally in a downtrend, Gordon says that this rate of change in momentum means that the ""interest to sell is decreasing"" for TLT, and TLT is about to head higher.
• Gordon also mentions that the move against the trend typically mirrors the level of the fourth wave, in this case $122 on TLT.
• This $122 level on TLT, according to Gordon, is also confirmed by small Elliott waves that are found within each wave, and even those indicate that TLT is heading to $122.
• As a result, Gordon wants to buy the June monthly 118-strike put and sell the June monthly 122-strike put for a total of 90 cents, or $90 per options spread.
• If TLT closes above $122 on June 15 expiration, Gordon could make $314 on the trade. If TLT closes below $118 on June 15expiration, however, Gordon would lose the $90 he paid for the trade.
The trade: Gordon is suggesting buying the June monthly 118/122 put spread for 90 cents, or $90 per options spread.
Bottom line: Gordon believes that bond prices will rise, and TLT will return to $122.",2018-05-24T22:09:00.000+03:00
5408,"Trump made dairy access a big issue, but NAFTA 2.0 may bring only 'marginal' concessions from Canada","With a preliminary NAFTA deal possible next week, attention is turning to how it could potentially affect U.S. agriculture.
Canada's dairy market is protected by high tariffs and has been a key bone of contention by the U.S. but experts expect only ""marginal"" concessions from Ottawa. There's also an anti-dumping provision aimed at Mexico that has been sought by Florida and U.S. Southeast specialty crop producers, but analysts say it could ignite trade retaliation.
""What dairy farmers in America need now is some good news,"" Tom Vilsack, president of the U.S. Dairy Export Council and former secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told CNBC in an interview. ""Prices are very low, things are very stressed on the farm, and they see free trade agreements being negotiated by their competitors that open up market access.""
'Opening up' Canada's dairy market In fact, Michigan and portions of the U.S. Northeast had milk prices so low last fall that it was being dumped as production exceeded the capacity to process the product. Vilsack called it ""incredibly important"" that any renegotiation of NAFTA include progress on ""opening up"" of the Canadian dairy market.
Officials from Canada, Mexico and the United States met this week in Washington, and a Mexican business representative said Tuesday an agreement in principle could be reached next week, according to Reuters .
Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Soybeans are harvested in Princeton, Illinois. ""NAFTA, as you know, is moving along,"" President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday. The president added, ""I could make a deal really quickly, but I'm not sure that's in the best interests of the United States. But we'll see what happens.""
$40 billion in agricultural exports Mexico and Canada together represent nearly one-third of total U.S. agricultural exports, or about $40 billion last year , according to the USDA. Corn, wheat, soybeans, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as livestock and dairy, are major U.S. exports to those countries.
The future of NAFTA has been clouded ever since Trump notified Congress last May that the U.S. wanted to renegotiate the deal with Mexico and Canada. During this time, Trump has threatened to scrap the 24-year-old trade agreement.
""Pulling out of NAFTA would be a horrendous mistake,"" said former USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agriculture think tank based in Washington. ""There are some improvements that can be made in this agreement, but understand that status quo is a far better deal than getting bad changes to this agreement.""
Mexico diversifies beyond NAFTA Amid the uncertainty over NAFTA and strained relations with the Trump administration, Mexico has looked to diversify trade partners beyond the United States.
Mexico strengthened its trade ties with major producers in Latin America and looked for new suppliers of corn, wheat and soy, among other commodities. Mexico is the top buyer of U.S. corn, but shipments of corn from Brazil soared more than 900 percent last year .
On Saturday, Mexico announced an agreement in principle on an updated free trade agreement with the European Union that will allow more goods to be exported tariff-free, including in the agricultural sector.
Vilsack said the new Mexico-EU trade deal ""could potentially impact access to a market that we have been dominant in."" He added that there's also the recent EU-Japan trade agreement, and one of the EU's biggest food exports to Japan is dairy products.
Mexico ranks as the largest U.S. dairy export market, accounting for about double the size of the industry's number two market, Canada. One of the biggest global competitors for American dairy producers is the EU, the leading exporter of many dairy products, particularly cheeses.
For Trump, concerns about NAFTA go well beyond agriculture to industries such as auto manufacturing. But when it comes to agribusiness, the president has been very vocal in the past about Canada's dairy industry.
Trump calls Canada 'a disgrace' A year ago, Trump tweeted about Canada hurting U.S. dairies in border states such as Wisconsin and vowed the U.S. ""will not stand for this."" He also fumed: ""What they have done to our dairy farmer workers is a disgrace.""
TRUMP TWEET
Even top Democratic lawmakers have weighed in on the Canadian dairy restrictions and pressed the Trump administration to act.
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., vented this week about ""reversing restrictive dairy pricing policies in Canada that are hurting our dairy producers at their core ."" The Senate minority leader also revealed in remarks delivered during an appearance at an upstate New York dairy farm that if the Canadian situation is not addressed in the updated NAFTA it would be unacceptable.
Canada uses a supply-management program to support various agricultural sectors, including dairy and cheese. In early 2017, the Canadian dairy industry created a new class of milk prices for so-called ultrafiltered milk, which is used to make cheese, yogurt and ice cream. Some U.S. officials have criticized the move as protectionist and harmful to American dairy farmers.
""In addition to Canada's 270 percent tariff on milk, a program called the 'Class 7' pricing program, a market-distorting supply management system, has caused severe pain to New York dairy producers like Avon's Anderson Farm and their fellow Upstate Niagara Co-Op dairies since it came into force last year,"" Schumer said earlier this week . ""In fact, Canada has used the Class 7 program to triple its milk powder exports in the past year by creating excess milk production capacity within Canada, then dumping the resulting milk powder onto world markets.""
Milk politics in Canada Regardless, Canada has defended itself against claims the dairy incentives they have are protectionism and contend they shouldn't be blamed for excess milk capacity by American dairy producers. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has even said the system ""works very well"" for Canada.
U.S. and Canadian experts say there's a slim chance of major dairy concessions from Ottawa. They point out domestic pressure from Canada's dairy industry is significant and complicated by elections later this year in the two large dairy provinces, Quebec and Ontario.
""They'd walk away from a deal before they would actually give up supply management at this point,"" said Kevin Carmichael, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank in Waterloo, Ontario. ""It's just too sensitive for the Canadians.""
'Marginal' concessions To secure trade agreements with the EU and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, though, Canada granted some dairy access. As a result, Carmichael expects Canada will do same for the United States, but he suggests ""you're going to see something marginal.""
Others agree no significant concessions from Canada are likely on the dairy side.
""They won't liberalize dairy very much,"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury international trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington D.C. ""They might do some token stuff on ice cream but it won't amount to anything.""
Mexico's 'dumping' of fresh produce Meanwhile, some U.S. Southeast agricultural groups representing specialty fruit and vegetable producers want changes in NAFTA 2.0 that would allow them to pursue anti-subsidy and anti-dumping cases or seek temporary import quotas. They accuse Mexico of ""dumping"" product such as seasonal tomatoes and other fresh produce into the U.S. market.
FLORIDA TWEET
""It would give seasonal producers a standing to file anti-dumping claims in the United States, which they usually don't get to do,"" said Inu Manak, a visiting scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington.
Added Manak: ""You could have a lot of retaliation from Mexico. You also open the floodgates to a lot of various claims that could be quite dangerous.""
Former USDA chief economist Glauber agrees, suggesting that U.S. could be vulnerable for shipping apples to Mexico or seasonal trade done with Canada.
""We compete with a lot of their industries at various points in time,"" said Glauber.
Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz., whose state is a key entry point for fresh produce from Mexico to the U.S., has pushed the Trump administration to remove seasonal protection of perishable products from the NAFTA talks.
Yet there are others, including Florida Sens. Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat up for re-election this year, who have pushed to include perishable and seasonal protection policies in the NAFTA renegotiations. The two lawmakers wrote a letter earlier this month to urge Senate Finance Committee leaders to support Florida farmers on the matter.
""NAFTA has undoubtedly expanded U.S. agricultural exports, and that is a great result for American farmers,"" Rubio and Nelson wrote. ""But our exports have succeeded at the expense of Florida farmers who have been systematically undercut at home by Mexican agricultural subsidies, poor labor standards, and seasonal dumping.""

The U.S. stock market will likely run higher for another 11 years, according to Tom Lee, a widely followed Wall Street market strategist. 
""Both [Fundstrat technical strategist Rob Sluymer and I] think it's more like 2029 is the peak of this equity market cycle and then, the S&P is 6,000 to 15,000,"" said Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, on CNBC's "" Halftime Report "" on Friday. 
""So I think it's just important to be long-term oriented right now."" Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters 
That view is based on Lee's analysis of economic data such as housing starts and auto sales that indicate the economy is likely only in the middle of the global business cycle. He also expects that funds will flow out of bonds into stocks in search of better returns, especially since many bonds still have negative yields, meaning investors essentially are paying for their investments. 
""The allocation should be going up in equities,"" Lee said. ""Basically no S&P company makes you pay them to own it."" 
Such optimistic comments contrast with those of most market watchers, who say stocks are likely close to the end of their yearslong rally. The S&P 500 is trading near all-time highs and in its second-longest bull market on record, a period without a drop of at least 20 percent from a recent high. 
Lee has a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 3,025, about 8 percent above Friday's levels and toward the higher end of the range of market strategists surveyed by CNBC. 
""We've had so much caution since '09 that animal spirits have been depressed,"" Lee said. 
""Last year, 2017, was probably the first time in nine years that I thought institutions were actually bullish,"" Lee said, adding that he doesn't particularly find any Fundstrat institutional clients that optimistic on stocks right now since they did so well last year. 
Before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014, Lee was the top stock strategist at J.P. Morgan. He was one of the few on Wall Street to predict that President Donald Trump 's election win in 2016 would cause a rally in stocks rather than a sell-off.

4646,Here's the other dangerous weapon any deal with North Korea must address,"On Friday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to begin a process that many hope will result in the denuclearization of North Korea.
If successful, President Donald Trump will meet with Kim Jong-un in the following weeks to potentially strike a deal that few thought was possible only months ago.
While it is understandable that North Korea's denuclearization will be the focus of those talks, the joint American, British, and French response to Syria's use of chemical weapons on its own population underscores why Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo has pressed President Trump to also include the elimination of North Korea's chemical and biological weapons in any agreement with Pyongyang.
North Korea Syria connection Coverage of the strike on three Syrian chemical weapons facilities has not mentioned North Korea, but Pyongyang has played a role in helping Syria to facilitate its chemical weapons program. Earlier this year the United Nations Panel of Experts documented evidence of illicit trade and suspected technical assistance by North Korea related to Syria's chemical weapons program.
According to the Panel of Experts , North Korean technicians have worked at Syrian chemical weapons facilities at Adra, Hama, and Barzah, likely one of the facilities struck in the recent attack.
Beyond providing technical support, the Panel of Experts has documented North Korean efforts to ship equipment necessary for Syria's chemical weapons programs. The report indicates that North Korea has supplied Syria with special resistance valves, thermometers, and acid resistant tiles used in the production of chemical weapons.
North Korea is not merely willing to sell chemical weapons to other states; it has also demonstrated a willingness to use them. In Malaysia last year, North Korea assassinated Kim Jong-un's half-brother Kim Jong-nam in public at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport with a VX nerve agent , which is banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.
What's in the stockpiles While the exact composition of North Korea's chemical weapons programs is unknown, it is believed to possess between 2,500 and 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons and the capacity to produce up to 12,000 metric tons.
Among its stockpiles, North Korea is suspected to have nerve agents such as VX and sarin, blister agents such as mustard gas, toxins that attack the blood and respiratory system, as well as crowd control agents. North Korea is also suspected to have supplied chemical weapons to its forward deployed units near the DMZ.
In addition to chemical weapons, North Korea also possesses the capability to cultivate biological weapons. According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense , North Korea is capable of cultivating biological agents such as anthrax, small pox, and other pathogens. Other sources have suggested that North Korea can produce pathogens such as cholera, the plague, and dysentery.
Although North Korea is a party to the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention , it is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Any agreement on North Korea's weapons programs should achieve three objectives in relations to Pyongyang's chemical and biological weapons programs.
North Korea should make a full declaration of its chemical and biological weapons, it should agree to fully dismantle its programs and not reconstitute them, and it should agree to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Let's not repeat the mistakes of Iran deal Inevitably, North Korea will seek sanctions relief as part of any agreement to give up its nuclear program. However, as part of UN Security Council Resolution 2270 , North Korea is required to follow through on its obligations under the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, as well as to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and meet the commitments it would entail. Until it takes those steps, UN sanctions should not be loosened.
One of the criticisms of the Iran nuclear deal is that the agreement did not address Iran's ability to conduct missile tests and to engage in destabilizing activities in the Middle East. In essence, that the agreement was incomplete.
While the elimination of North Korea's nuclear capability is the most important objective for the upcoming talks between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, an agreement that does not also address North Korea's chemical and biological weapons capabilities would also be an incomplete agreement.

6484,UPDATE 4-Petrobras slashes diesel prices to ease Brazil trucker protest,"UPDATE 4-Petrobras slashes diesel prices to ease Brazil trucker protest Alexandra Alper and Maria Carolina Marcello Published 14 Hours Ago
* Diesel price cut by 10 pct, frozen for 15 days
* Petrobras CEO denies government interference
* New York-listed shares down 7.5 pct after close (Adds lower house vote on plan to resolve strike, paragraphs 9-10)
RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA, May 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-led oil company Petrobras on Wednesday temporarily cut diesel prices by 10 percent in order to help the government and truck drivers resolve a protest crippling highways.
The surprise decision, aimed at resolving a standoff threatening grains exports, industrial output and even fuel supply at airports and gas stations, will bring immediate relief for angry truckers but raise investor concerns about government interference at Petroleo Brasileiro SA.
New York-listed shares of Petrobras fell as much as 7.5 percent in after-market trading, after closing 3.8 percent lower on Wednesday.
Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente said the price cut, which will only remain in place for 15 days and cost the company about 350 million reais ($96 million), had not been demanded by the government.
""The independence of Petrobras has not been damaged,"" Parente said at a news conference explaining the decision. ""It was an exceptional measure and does not represent a change to our pricing policy.""
Near-daily price adjustments at Petrobras have let the company track global prices and turn a profit on fuel sales after losing money for years at the government's insistence part of a turnaround that lifted shares nearly 90 percent since the pricing policy started last July.
While Petrobras' price cut brings momentary relief to truckers, policymakers struggled to reach a more lasting accord during talks with the drivers' representatives in Brasilia, who threatened to extend their protests into a fourth day.
A group representing the truckers did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the price cut.
Late on Wednesday, Brazil's lower house of Congress approved the main text of a bill aimed at resolving the protest, with the measure now passing to the Senate. In addition to eliminating the CIDE tax on diesel, it cut the PIS/Cofins tax on the fuel to zero.
Before the bill's passage, congressman and rapporteur for the bill, Orlando Silva, said it would reduce the final cost of diesel by 14 percent.
Earlier in the day, the government and truckers groups met at the office of Eliseu Padilha, President Michel Temer's chief of staff, but failed to reach an accord after the government did not present a plan to reduce diesel costs, a spokesman for ABCAM, which represents the protesters, told reporters after the meeting.
Padilha, calling the meeting tense but fruitful, said there would be another meeting on Thursday. He said lost tax revenue would be offset with additional payroll taxes.
It was the first such meeting between the government and truckers since they began partially blocking roads in several states on Monday to protest surging diesel prices.
Temer had called for ""a type of truce for two or three days at most for us to find a satisfactory solution for Brazilians and for the truckers.""
However, ABCAM said the strike would continue.
SOY EXPORTS AT RISK
Brazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar, most of which reach ports by road.
Concerns that the protest could halt shipments of Brazil's record soy crop have contributed to the steepest rally in soy futures in 10 months in Chicago trading, with prices up 4.5 percent in four consecutive days of increases.
Oilseed trade group Abiove said some soybean crushers were suspending operations due to the protest. Sugarcane industry group Unica said certain mills had reduced harvesting work due to short fuel supplies.
Meat processor Marfrig Global Foods SA said on Wednesday some of its plants are reducing or suspending output due to lack of deliveries during the protest.
State airport operator Infraero suggested that passengers check with airlines on the status of their flights and warned carriers to check that there is enough jet fuel to refuel planes at airports before clearing flights.
According to Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price of diesel paid by consumers. The average retail price of diesel is now 3.595 reais per liter.
Padilha said policymakers had already determined how to offset the elimination of the CIDE fuel tax, which represents about 1 percent of diesel costs. However, he said congressional leaders still had to find about 12.5 billion reais ($3.5 billion) in new revenue in order to halve for six months the PIS/Cofins tax, which makes up about 10 percent of diesel costs.
He said the Finance Ministry would also discuss with states a possible reduction of the ICMS state tax burden on diesel.

The chairman of Roubini Macro Associates, also known as ""Dr Doom"" for his pessimistic economic outlooks, called the price crash on Twitter on Tuesday.

Roubini was referencing a Congressional hearing that will see Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), testify in front of lawmakers about cryptocurrencies.
The economist also used the term HODL, which stands for ""hold on for dear life."" It originated in an online forum when someone spelled the word ""hold"" wrong. It has now become a meme and is often used in times of extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency market for people holding rather than selling.
Roubini said that ""HODL nuts"" will hold bitcoin until it plummets to zero.
Dr Doom also said that traders will use wash trading to prop up the prices. Wash trading in the crypto world involves someone buying and selling their own order to manipulate markets. Some have feared that wash trading takes place on bitcoin exchanges.
Roubini asked if the authorities will look into this practice.

His tweets followed comments on Bloomberg last week in which he called bitcoin the ""biggest bubble in human history.""

CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd. said on Wednesday it is in the process of exiting the global sugar trading business in order to concentrate on its core grains and agriculture operations, after reporting a fourth-quarter loss. 
White Plains, N.Y.-based Bunge has previously said it was looking at options to divest from its sugar unit, which includes milling operations in Brazil. 
Chief Executive Soren Schroder said on a conference call Bunge had struggled over the last year to generate enough gross margin to cover costs in sugar. The plans to sell Bunge's sugar milling business were not dependent on keeping the company's global sugar trading operations, he said.

2959,Markets brace for shaky Friday after trade war fears pound stock prices,"Fears of a trade war slammed stocks Thursday and could keep investors sidelined Friday, as the market looks set on a course to retest the February lows.
""I guess I wouldn't buy here. I want to understand more about what's going on, but for long term equity holders I would not use this as a reason to sell,"" said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors.
Ablin and others said the market could be first heading to test the 200-day moving average, which it did not break in the February selloff. On the S&P 500, that is currently 2,584, about 60 points from Thursday's close. The February low was another 50 points below that.
President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would put tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, and trade officials have recommended 10 high tech industries be specifically targeted.
The sell off also follows the Fed's latest rate hike Wednesday and new forecasts for more hikes next year and the following year.
""That's the current trend, but it doesn't take away from the fact that monetary policy is tightening and that typically doesn't end well,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Bleakley Financial Group. ""Overall the headwinds grow, the deeper we get into monetary tightening."" He also said the S&P could test the 200-day moving average sometime this quarter.
U.S. industries vulnerable to potential Chinese countermeasures were hit hard, as investors reacted to concerns the tariffs could lead to a trade war that would hurt corporate profits and the global economy.
Industrial stocks, for instance were down 3.3 percent, while Boeing was down more than 5 percent. Caterpillar was down 5.7 percent, in its worst decline since Brexit, when the British voted to leave the European Union.
Tech, weaker with Facebook , could also vulnerable to trade issues, and it lost 2.7 percent.
The Dow closed down 724 points, or nearly 3 percent at 23,957, and the S&P 500 lost 2.5 percent to 2,643. Nasdaq tumbled 2.4 percent to 7,166.
""I think at some point, either it's they reach some kind of deal or back away from it. It's hard to really know,"" said Ablin. ""This isn't something we can measure fundamentally. The good news is it's self-inflicted. It's a contrived crisis. It's not a meteor coming from outer space. We can fix it just as easily as we broke it.""
As stocks plunged, investors sought safety in Treasurys, and yields, which move opposite price, fell with the 10-year yield falling as low as 2.80 percent.
""There was $2.1 billion to sell on the bell. That's what took you to the lows. I would say 80 percent of this is the trade war, and then you add all the other incidentals, like the lawyer resigning,"" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS.
Stocks took a leg down around midday when headlines crossed that John Dowd, Trump's lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, had resigned.
""People are definitely losing faith in Trump. They're losing faith in him getting more done just in general,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Redler said he expects the market could bounce Friday, but it may not end up higher as investors watch for more price discovery.
""People were hoping he would lighten up. Instead of $50 billion, he could have made it $30 billion or $40 billion, but he said it could even be more,"" said Redler.
Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said the dollar impact of the tariffs would obviously be smaller than the $50 billion in goods they are targeting.
""From a dollar amount even if China responded proportionately, it's $30 billion in the global economy,"" he said. Clifton said the move could be typical of Trump, dramatic at first but then later softened as a negotiating tactic.
""Everything he does, he throws out a big thing and over time it gets watered down. He's trying to bring China to the negotiating table,"" said Clifton.
But the market is spooked, and the weakness of February has returned but with then market leader, tech, weakened by the Facebook data scandal.
""We had a 12 percent move off the highs going into those Feb. 9 lows with better leadership fro technology. Now the market feels worse, and we're still above [the lows.] Why wouldn't we test it?"" said Redler.

Apple is having an event this month to ""hear creative new ideas for teachers and students,"" according to an invitation released to the media Friday. 
The event will be held at a Chicago high school on March 27 at 10 a.m, according to the invitation, which said ""Let's take a field trip."" 
As usual, the invitation was thin on details — Apple is notoriously tight-lipped about future products and programs. But while the event would be a departure from past March confabs which are usually held in the Bay Area, it would fall in line with recent initiatives at the tech giant. 
Apple has always had strong partnerships with schools and universities, but has expanded in recent years to support coding education programs and education for young women. 
Apple's "" Everybody Can Code "" program, focused on mobile apps, recently expanded to 70 colleges and universities in Europe. And the iPhone maker announced a major partnership in January to fund 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai's women's education advocacy . 
The invitation's script is reminiscent of a past launch. In March 2016 Apple unveiled the new iPad Pro , with Apple Pencil support. The company's iPad devices host Swift Playgrounds, a code education platform. 
Technology like augmented and virtual reality has already been used in classrooms to expand the traditional ""field trip"" experience for students, and Apple has expressed interest in that area, too.

The New York Times' stock rallied about 90 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's roughly 22 percent gain since Trump's critical tweet on Nov. 13, 2016. Joshua Roberts | Reuters Donald Trump 
In the past week President Donald Trump has criticized Amazon five times over tax issues and CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post , sparking a decline of more than 8 percent in the company's shares since the first tweet over three trading sessions. 
But many of the companies Trump criticized on social media since his election victory thrived following his negative tweets. 
For example Trump repeatedly attacked The New York Times including a tweet on Nov. 13. 2016. The media company's shares rallied about 90 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's approximate 22 percent gain in same time period due to its strong earnings and digital subscription growth . Defense companies have come under Trump's fire.
The president went after Boeing for its Air Force One price tag on Dec. 6, 2016. Boeing shares are up more than 110 percent since the post versus the S&P 500's approximate 20 percent gain. The White House reached a new deal with the company for two new Air Force One planes in February.
Lockheed Martin was also criticized by Trump for its F-35 ""cost overruns"" on Dec. 22, 2016. Tweet Link 
Its shares rallied about 35 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's approximate 17 percent gain since the tweet. 
To be sure, much of the gains for Boeing and Lockheed came after meetings Trump had with the chief executives of both companies to discuss his criticism. 
The two stocks also benefited from Trump's budget, which increased defense spending by nearly $80 billion. 
And not every company rallies after a Trump critique. Merck suffered after the president blasted the drug maker for its prices on Aug. 14, 2017 
Merck shares declined about 13 percent versus the market's 7 percent gain since the post. 
But overall it seems Trump's attacks aren't materially affecting stock prices over the long run.

5104,Comey memo: Trump complained about Flynn's 'judgment issues',"In a series of startlingly candid conversations, President Donald Trump told former FBI Director James Comey that he had serious concerns about the judgment of a top adviser, asked about the possibility of jailing journalists and described a boast from Vladimir Putin about Russian prostitutes, according to Comey's notes of the talks obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday night.
The 15 pages of documents contain new details about a series of interactions with Trump that Comey found so unnerving that he chose to document them in writing. Those seven encounters in the weeks and months before Comey's May 2017 firing include a Trump Tower discussion about allegations involving Trump and prostitutes in Moscow; a White House dinner at which Comey says Trump asked him for his loyalty; and a private Oval Office discussion where the ex-FBI head says the president asked him to end an investigation into Michael Flynn, the former White House national security adviser.
Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing about his dealings with President Donald Trump on June 8, 2017. The documents had been eagerly anticipated since their existence was first revealed last year, especially since Comey's interactions with Trump are a critical part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the president sought to obstruct justice. Late Thursday night, Trump tweeted that the memos ""show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.""
Trump tweet: James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
The president also accused Comey of leaking classified information. The memos obtained by the AP were unclassified, though some portions were blacked out as classified. Details from Comey's memos reported in news stories last year appear to come from the unclassified portions.
In explaining the purpose of creating the memos, which have been provided to Mueller, Comey has said he ""knew there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened"" to defend not only himself but the FBI as well.
The memos cover the first three months of the Trump administration, a period of upheaval marked by staff turnover, a cascade of damaging headlines and revelations of an FBI investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The documents reflect Trump's uneasiness about that investigation, though not always in ways that Comey seemed to anticipate.
In a February 2017 conversation, for instance, Trump told Comey how Putin told him, ""we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world"" even as the president adamantly, and repeatedly, distanced himself from a salacious allegation concerning him and prostitutes in Moscow, according to one memo.
In another memo, Comey recounts how Trump at a private White House dinner pointed his fingers at his head and complained that Flynn, his embattled national security adviser, ""has serious judgment issues."" The president blamed Flynn for failing to alert him promptly to a congratulatory call from a world leader, causing a delay for Trump in returning a message to an official whose name is redacted in the documents.
""I did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgment of any FBI interest in or contact with General Flynn,"" Comey wrote.
By that point, the FBI had already interviewed Flynn about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and the Justice Department had already warned White House officials that they were concerned Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail.
Flynn was fired Feb. 13, 2017, after White House officials said he had misled them about his Russian contacts during the transition period by saying that he had not discussed sanctions. The following day, according to a separate memo, Comey says Trump cleared the Oval Office of other officials, encouraged him to let go of the investigation into Flynn and called him a good guy. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is now cooperating with Mueller's investigation.
The memos reveal that days before Flynn's firing, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus asked Comey if Flynn's communications were being monitored under a secret surveillance warrant.
""Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?"" Priebus asked Comey, according to the memos, referring to an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
Comey said he ""paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had to be asked and answered through established channels.""
Comey's response is redacted on the unclassified memos.
The memos also show Trump's continued distress at a dossier of allegations — compiled by an ex-British spy whose work was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign — examining potential ties between him and his aides and the Kremlin. Comey writes how Trump repeatedly denied to him having been involved in an encounter with Russian prostitutes in a Moscow hotel.
""The President said 'the hookers thing' is nonsense,"" Comey writes, noting that Trump then related the conversation with Putin about the ""most beautiful hookers."" Comey says Trump did not say when Putin had made the comment.
The documents also include the president's musings about pursuing leakers and imprisoning journalists. They also provide insight into Comey's personal and professional opinions. He judges the administration's travel ban to be legally valid, and he takes a swipe at former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, calling her predecessor, Eric Holder, ""smarter and more sophisticated and smoother.""
The memos were provided to Congress earlier Thursday as House Republicans escalated criticism of the Justice Department, threatening to subpoena the documents and questioning officials.
In a letter sent to three Republican House committee chairmen Thursday evening, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that the department was sending a classified version of the memos and an unclassified version. The department released Boyd's letter publicly but did not release the memos. The chairmen issued a statement late Thursday saying the memos show that Comey clearly never felt threatened, and Trump didn't obstruct justice.
Justice officials had allowed some lawmakers to view the memos but had never provided copies to Congress. Boyd wrote that the department had also provided the memos to several Senate committees.
Boyd wrote in the letter that the department ""consulted the relevant parties"" and concluded that releasing the memos would not adversely affect any ongoing investigations. Mueller is investigating potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign as well as possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Comey is on a publicity tour to promote his new book, ""A Higher Loyalty."" He revealed last year that he had written the memos after conversations with Trump.
He said in an interview Thursday with CNN that he's ""fine"" with the Justice Department turning his memos over to Congress.
""I think what folks will see if they get to see the memos is I've been consistent since the very beginning, right after my encounters with President Trump, and I'm consistent in the book and tried to be transparent in the book as well,"" he said.",2018-04-20T04:38:00.000+03:00

5188,"Saudi oil giant Aramco may be more profitable than Apple, according to disputed financial leak","Leaked financial information for the world's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, reveals one of the most closely held secrets in the energy industry, if the figures are accurate.
Saudi Arabia's national oil company earned $33.8 billion in the first half of 2017, according to financial information obtained by Bloomberg News and disputed by the company.
For comparison, Apple , the world's most valuable publicly traded company, earned $28.9 billion in the same period. Aramco's second-half earnings for 2017 are more than four times the $7.4 billion earned by Exxon Mobil , the largest energy company by market capitalization.
The documents viewed by Bloomberg also lay out other key financial metrics and details of Aramco's royalty structure .
The information potentially offers investors the most comprehensive overview of Aramco's finances yet. The leak comes as Saudi Aramco continues to weigh the right time to launch a public share offering that will almost certainly mark the largest stock market debut ever.
However, Aramco is disputing the report, telling Bloomberg, ""This is inaccurate, Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.""
Aramco did not immediately return CNBC's request to explain which aspects of the financial report and tax information it considers inaccurate.
show chapters Saudi crown prince wraps up jam-packed US tour      7:17 AM ET Wed, 4 April 2018 | 02:42 The information viewed by Bloomberg also says Aramco generated $52.1 billion in cash from its operations, one of the most important metrics in the oil and gas industry. Exxon's cash flow from operations was $15.2 billion during the same period, or $16 billion including asset sales.
A Bloomberg analysis of the data found that Aramco's cost of extracting oil was less than $4 a barrel, significantly lower than its big oil peers.
Several people who are knowledgeable about Aramco's operations told CNBC that figure is likely too low, though the cost is almost certainly in the single digits. Saudi Arabia is often said to break even on new oil production at roughly $5 a barrel.
Aramco paid a $13 billion dividend to its sole shareholder, the Saudi government, Bloomberg reports.
Saudi Arabia cut Aramco's tax rate from 85 percent of its income to 50 percent. The information obtained by Bloomberg lays out a new royalty structure that was also implemented in early 2017.
The royalty is pegged at 20 percent when oil fetches up to $70 a barrel and rises to 50 percent when crude prices break above $100 a barrel. The fee applies to all of Aramco's liquids production, a change from the previous structure, which applied a 20 percent royalty only to exports of crude oil and refined products.

6954,"After US embassy makes controversial move to Jerusalem, more countries follow its lead","CNBC.com Ronen Zvulun | AFP | Getty Images (L to R) Sara Netanyahu and her husband Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin applaud as Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and his wife Hilda Patricia Marroquin cut the ribbon during the inauguration ceremony of the Guatemalan embassy in Jerusalem on May 16, 2018.
The United States received intense international criticism on Monday when it celebrated the opening of its embassy in Jerusalem . It was the first country to make the ""provocative"" move from Tel Aviv .
But on Wednesday, Guatemala joined the U.S. in moving its embassy to Jerusalem.
More countries are preparing to make the leap. Paraguay 's Foreign Ministry announced that its embassy will also relocate to Jerusalem , while the Czech Republic , Romania and Honduras reportedly considering the move.
These smaller countries, especially those in Latin America, may be looking to cement good relations with the U.S. in hopes of preserving foreign aid and trading status. Some are also enhancing relationships with Israel, which has courted some of them with aid and even arms sales.
Jonathan Cristol, a fellow at the World Policy Institute, said that he doesn't believe the U.S. pressured countries like Guatemala into moving, but the U.S. embassy opening did make it possible for these countries to do so without ""bearing the political cost.""
The U.S. took a political hit in December when the United Nations voted to condemn President Donald Trump 's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which angered leaders throughout the Middle East. Palestinian protests turn violent
On Tuesday, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting that rebuked Israel after its forces killed more than 60 Palestinian protesters on the Gaza border the same day the U.S. unveiled its new embassy. Monday also marked the 70th anniversary of Israel's founding, a day the Palestinians call Nakba, or Day of Catastrophe.
Palestinians have been protesting at the Gaza border since March, asserting that they also have a claim on Jerusalem, which has deep significance to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths.
With the U.S. bearing the brunt of the international blowback, smaller countries that have had historically close ties to Israel are able to consider making their moves, but Cristol said this does not signal a mass relocation of embassies to Jerusalem.
Countries like Guatemala and Paraguay have something to gain by moving their embassies to Jerusalem. Jon Alterman, a senior vice president and director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that Israel has long courted smaller countries.
""It has conducted extensive outreach in Africa , for example, and it has ties throughout Latin America,"" Alterman said in an email.
Cristol said these smaller countries have received developmental assistance or arms sales, so ""they'll do better with a close relationship with Israel.""
Cristol also noted that Latin American countries, including Guatemala, have Evangelical Christian heads of state, so it is a ""natural inclination"" for those countries to move their embassies to Jerusalem. Evangelical connection
Some evangelicals believe the transfer of the embassy and the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital will help bring about the so-called Rapture , an event in which they believe all Christians, living and dead, will join with God, the Independent wrote.
Evangelical Christians supported Trump's decision to relocate the U.S. embassy, according to CNN .
But would larger countries like Russia , China and Western European nations make the move?
""I would be very surprised,"" Cristol said. ""I would be astounded, frankly, if the major Western European powers, with the possible exception of the United Kingdom , would move their embassies any time soon.""
Cristol mentioned the UK as a possibility because the current British government is more conservative than other European powers and it ""has a fairly large, but often overlooked, Christian constituency that is highly supportive of Israel,"" he said.
Cristol added that Russia and China are also unlikely candidates. Those countries will continue to do business with Israel regardless of where their embassies are located, he said, ""so why take the risk?""
If any of them do make future moves to Israel, however, they will need to do what the Trump administration did not do, Alterman said, ""which is to explicitly state that the embassy is located in West Jerusalem and endorse the idea of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.""
Going forward, Israel will surely encourage more countries to move their embassies, Alterman said.
And for some countries ""on a practical level, Jerusalem is the capitol of Israel,"" Cristol added.
Most Israeli government officials and offices are located in Jerusalem, so countries with embassies in Tel Aviv have to travel to do business.
Relocating to Jerusalem is a smart money move for smaller states, making things more ""effective and efficient,"" Cristol said.
""Tel Aviv is only about an hour away,"" he added, ""but also sort of a world away.""",2018-05-17T22:44:00.000+03:00
4045,Just two stocks — Boeing and Goldman — have been responsible for keeping the Dow afloat this year,"Despite multiple bumps and bruises along the way, the bull market has remained intact in 2018. That wouldn't be the case, however, were it not for two stocks critical to this year's performance.
Goldman Sachs and Boeing alone have accounted for all but a handful of the 460 points the Dow Jones industrial average had gained heading into Tuesday trading, according to a review of FactSet data.
The other 28 companies in the blue chip index, including high flyers like Apple , J.P. Morgan Chase and Visa , have been about flat in terms of points contribution. The price-weighted index takes company share prices against a divisor, so moves in higher-priced companies have a more meaningful point impact for the index.
Boeing has contributed 316.5 points to the Dow this year, while Goldman has added 119.5. Conversely, McDonald's has subtracted about 92 points, while Procter & Gamble has taken away 76. That's left the Dow up just a little under 2 percent for the year.
All of the other companies lie somewhere in the middle in terms of Dow impact, even though some have posted significant gains. Because they're significantly cheaper in price, companies including Cisco Systems (up nearly 19 percent), Intel (13 percent) and even Microsoft (11 percent) haven't had as much point impact.
Boeing is up a respectable 15 percent while Goldman has gained more than 6 percent.
It's certainly not unusual for a small block of stocks to have a disproportionate Dow impact, but market breadth is considered important when gauging the strength of a rally.
""There are some very interesting behind-the-scenes signals out there that investors should be aware of, telling us that we are transitioning to something new and different,"" David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, said in his daily note.
Weakness in breadth, or how widespread gains are, is one such signal.
Rosenberg points out that while the S&P 500 is up more than 4 percent year to date, sector breadth has been weak. The median of the 11 groups, materials, is up less than 1 percent for the year. Technology has been the best performer, with a gain approaching 11 percent, while utilities are off nearly 7 percent to lead the five negative sectors.
""What we are left with is a level of volatility that is 50% higher now than it was on average for all of last year,"" Rosenberg said. ""So we had a huge bounce to all-time highs, then a record correction in such a short period of time, [then] a rally back close to the highs which looks just as tempting to chase as was the case when [GMO founder] Jeremy Grantham was openly discussing a two-year 60% melt-up at the turn of the year.""
As a cap-weighted and much broader index, the S&P 500 rarely sees outsized contributions from individual stocks. The biggest point contributor thus far has been Amazon, which has added just 2.7 points to the index's 96-point gain. The biggest company in terms of percentage gains has been XL Group, which has surged 58 percent.

Several of Triangle's kratom products were found to contain salmonella, the FDA said, and the agency requested the company to issue a voluntary recall. The agency has been investigating a salmonella outbreak that had infected 87 people as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Kratom, or Mitragyna speciosa, is a plant that grows in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Some people take it as a way to treat opioid addiction, while others take it recreationally. 
The FDA has warned consumers not to use kratom because it appears to affect the brain in similar ways as opioids and could expose users to similar risks of dependency and addiction.
""We continue to have serious concerns about the safety of any kratom containing product and we are pursuing these concerns separately,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. ""But the action today is based on the risks posed by the contamination of this particular product with a potentially dangerous pathogen.""
This is the first time the agency has ordered a mandatory recall of contaminated food products; it had threatened to do so twice in the past.

David Solomon, Goldman Sachs' president and co-chief operating officer, has a thing for fine wine . And now his former personal assistant has been accused of stealing hundreds of bottles worth $1.2 million from his private collection. 
Nicolas De-Meyer, 40, was identified in an indictment unsealed Wednesday by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who say he used a fake name, ""Mark Miller,"" to sell hundreds of bottles of the stolen wine to a North Carolina wine dealer he had found on the internet from 2014 to 2016. 
The indictment didn't name Solomon, but Goldman confirmed his identity after press inquiries. De-Meyer was an employee of Solomon's household, not the bank. ""The theft was discovered in the fall of 2016 and reported to law enforcement at that time,"" a Goldman spokesman said in an email. ""They have been pursuing the matter."" 
That would correspond with the sale of Solomon's 5,400-square-foot apartment around the same time. The four-bedroom unit with a Central Park view and a 1,000-bottle wine storage area sold in November 2016 for $21.5 million. 
According to the indictment, De-Meyer worked for an ""individual who collects rare and expensive wine"" from 2008 to November 2016, and his duties included receiving shipments of wine at his boss's Manhattan apartment and transporting wine from there to a property in East Hampton, New York. 
Among the stolen items were seven bottles from the French estate Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, or DRC, which prosecutors say is considered among the best, most expensive and rarest in the world. The average price of a bottle of the pinot noir from Burgundy is $17,134, according to Wine-searcher.com. The victim had bought the bottles for $133,650, prosecutors said. 
De-Meyer stole the Romanee-Conti wine in October 2016 from his boss's Manhattan apartment, the indictment said. 
De-Meyer was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office in New York. He is to be presented in court in Los Angeles on Wednesday and ultimately to be arraigned in New York.",2018-01-17T19:42:00.000+02:00

During a recent panel discussion at the INTV conference in Jerusalem, producers of the popular Netflix series ""The Crown"" admitted to paying actress Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, less than her male co-star Matt Smith, who plays Queen Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip. 
According to Vanity Fair , ""the producers acknowledged that [Smith] did make more due to his 'Doctor Who'fame, but that they would rectify that for the future."" 
""Going forward, no one gets paid more than the queen,"" added producer Suzanne Mackie. 
However, with every role on the show being re-cast for its third season, Foy will not have a shot at receiving equal pay for her work. Source: Alex Bailey | Netflix The Crown, Netflix original series 
The series' gender pay gap, while shocking, is hardly uncommon for the entertainment industry. Earlier this year, it was reported that actor Mark Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million to reshoot scenes for ""All the Money in the World,"" while four-time Academy Award-nominee Michelle Williams was paid less than $1,000. Last year, Natalie Portman revealed that her co-star Ashton Kutcher was paid three times more than she was for their 2011 romantic comedy ""No Strings Attached."" 
""Compared to men, in most professions, women make 80 cents to the dollar,"" she said in a 2017 interview with Marie Claire UK . ""In Hollywood, we are making 30 cents to the dollar."" 
In February, Vanity Fair broke down the Hollywood quote system that governs how much actors earn, and noted that the industry's gender pay disparity is, in part, the result of pay being based on how much an individual was paid for previous projects. 
Before ""The Crown,"" Foy was a fairly unknown actress, while Smith had played BBC's famed ""Doctor Who."" But basing actors' compensation on they earned for previous projects can perpetuate a cycle in which women are underpaid over the full span of their careers. Foy earned an estimated $40,000 per episode , despite the fact that the series had a $7 million per episode budget, and it was Foy's head upon which the titular crown came to rest. show chapters 2:09 PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 | 01:03 
Though gender-based compensation issues in entertainment are not always analogous to the wider workforce, the challenge of ongoing underpayment of some workers is one that persists across industries. Last year, New York City joined a short list of places that banned employers from asking candidates about their previous salaries in an effort to narrow the gap. 
""Women and people of color deserve to be paid what they're worth, not held back by their current or previous salary,"" said Chair and Commissioner of the NYC Commission on Human Rights Carmelyn P. Malalis. ""[This] law will enable job seekers to negotiate a fair salary based on their skills and will help break the cycle of income inequality that has been so prevalent in the workforce for so long."" 
For anyone in or outside of Hollywood who is asked about their current salary, career coach Nicole Hill Orisich offers advice on how to properly answer the question while still leaving room for negotiation. 
She tells CNBC Make It that during an interview, a candidate should shift their answer to focus more on the skills they can offer. According to Orisich, an applicant should say something like, ""I'd love to talk about the value I bring to the table as well as the market value for this position. Based on my own research for someone with my skills in this industry, I believe market rate is somewhere between X and Y. I would be happy with something in this range.""

2294,Tax crackdown in Russia boosts grain traders' profits,"Tax crackdown in Russia boosts grain traders' profits Polina Devitt and Michael Hogan Published 1 Hour Ago 
* Russia is one of the world's top grain exporters 
* Government clamps down on tax avoidance in agriculture 
* Pre-tax margins rise to $5-6 after tax changes, from negative 
MOSCOW/HAMBURG, Feb 19 (Reuters) - A Russian crackdown on tax avoidance in the agriculture sector has been a boon for its grain traders, allowing them to buy directly from farmers and cut out a complex web of middlemen. 
Traders include big international commodities houses and some traders said profit margins on Russian grain had turned positive since the crackdown last year and now compared favorably with much of the business conducted in the European Union. 
""After the tax crackdown the Russian domestic market finally found itself working in a fair business environment, where entrepreneurial talent is now the driver of success rather than the 'creative ability' of some people to invent grey schemes in pursuit of building their competitive edge,"" a trader said. 
""Working on the Russian domestic market has become easier than before,"" he added. 
Many Russian grain exporters signed an informal and voluntary agreement last May promising from the 2017/18 marketing year that began last July to avoid working with firms suspected of failing to pay taxes - part of a broader clamp down by Moscow on tax avoidance in the agriculture sector. 
Russia's top 20 exporters of grain - responsible for 70 percent of the country's grain and oilseeds exports - have restructured their business in line with the tax service's request. 
The tax avoiding scheme involved buying and selling grain via a chain of transactions in which the value-added tax liability was left with a small trading company which then ceases to exist. 
Russia is one of the world's top grain exporters and the government was estimated to be losing 65 billion roubles ($1.1 billion) a year in unpaid taxes on grain deals at a time when it was seeking to tackle a budget deficit. 
The change meant Russia prevented the loss of 27.2 billion roubles ($471 million) from budget revenues in the second half of 2017, Varvara Burlevich, a senior Russian Tax Service official, told a grain conference in Moscow earlier this month. 
Under the tax avoidance scheme, supply chains were long and involved many small firms. Farmers also benefited as some of the profits from the schemes moved upstream and so they were not willing to work with grain exporters directly. 
""The grey schemes had the competitive advantage,"" another trader said. 
Firms suspected of involvement in the tax wheeze were squeezed out of the supply chain after the crackdown and lost their business as most traders now buy directly from farmers. 
Pre-tax margins have risen to about $5-6 per tonne, while net margins climbed to $2-3 per tonne due to the initiative, several traders said. They were negative before the crackdown due to Russia's large crop, one of the traders said. 
A German trader said pre-tax margins of $1 to $2 a tonne were normal on export business from Germany and other western European countries. ($1 = 56.4060 roubles) (Reporting by Polina Devitt in Moscow and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing by Susan Fenton)",2018-02-19T15:11:00.000+02:00
580,"How to step back when you know you're a micromanager, according to Marcus Lemonis","1 Hour Ago | 01:08 SHARES 
When it comes to running a successful and profitable company, self-made millionaire Marcus Lemonis is a firm believer that having people skills can make or break a leader's business. 
In this week's episode of CNBC's ""The Profit, "" Lemonis revealed how a California-based company bringing in millions in sales is on the brink of closing due to one of its owners' control and micromanagement issues. 
Husband and wife Jeff and Aimee Dougherty founded JD Custom Designs, a display manufacturing company, in 2009. In the following year, the business reached $2.4 million of revenue mainly by creating eye-catching retail displays for clients in the cosmetic industry. 
Despite bringing in over $1 million in sales each year over the previous few years, the company ran out of working capital in 2016. Without the funds to repair broken machines, delays piled up and sales slowed down. The business fell into $393,000 of debt. 
Though Jeff and Aimee are equal partners and owners of the business, Lemonis noticed that Jeff had an issue with micromanaging his wife and the rest of his staff. 
""If I can't persuade him to let go of the reins and help his wife and partner come into her own, JD Custom Designs could just disappear,"" Lemonis said. 
Here are three ways Lemonis helped Jeff resolve his desire for control, step away from his micromanaging ways and help turn his business around. The Profit Avoid distractions 
When Lemonis first visited JD Custom Designs, Jeff told him that he ran ""pretty much everything other than paperwork,"" a duty his wife asks him to stay out of. 
As Lemonis soon learned, Jeff has a habit of taking on too many tasks that he can't actually get to, which consequently impedes the company's productivity. 
""I know I wouldn't be able to do half the stuff my dad does,"" Wesley said. ""He's in the front, back, he's all over the place. It stresses me out. He's going to put himself in the ground the way he's going right now. He's trying to do everything by himself. It scares the hell out of me."" 
Lemonis noted that the company is ""so one-dimensional because Jeff pours all of his time into doing everybody else's job, as opposed to allowing people to do their job.""This would give him more ""free time to develop new ideas, develop new products,"" he added. Trust your team's abilities 
In the past, Jeff insisted on making sales himself despite his wife's background in sales. Lemonis, however, wasn't a fan. ""Seems like a role reversal,"" he said. 
To prove Aimee's ability to run a sales pitch, Lemonis set up a meeting with a footwear company he owns part of . Although Jeff nearly sabotaged her presentation, Aimee proved she believed in her ability to win over the new client for JD Custom Designs. 
""You build it and I can sell it,"" Aimee told Jeff. ""We each have our own jobs so let me do my job."" 
Impressed with Aimee's presentation and Jeff's new product design, Lemonis appreciated the changes the Doughertys were starting to make. 
""We want to be able to do anything that any company wants, but we ultimately have to change the culture. And that starts with you,"" Lemonis said, pointing to Jeff. ""Letting go and trusting your team."" Trust in your own abilities 
Before marrying Aimee, Jeff was a single father raising three children. As a result of a rough family upbringing, he said he felt the need to exert control through his business in order to provide for his family. 
""If I lose that control, it scares me because of what my family stands to lose,"" Jeff told Lemonis. ""My family is everything to me and I have a control issue yeah, because if I didn't, I [couldn't] take care of them."" 
Once he understood Jeff's background and need for control, Lemonis set out on working on the issue. 
""I think the fact that Jeff was vulnerable and disclosed why he is the way he is, it's a testament to the character of this man,"" Lemonis said. 
""You have to be the chief. That doesn't mean you don't get out of the shop and get your hands dirty that doesn't mean that you don't lead example,"" he told Jeff, ""but the way that you lead by example is also empowering these people."" 
Lemonis went on to comment that the equipment upgrades and improved confidence among the whole team would boost the company back into success. He projected the changes could bring in at least $5 million in the following year. 
""I love working with them because they do what they say they're going to do, they work their butts off and those are the kind of people I like being partners with,"" Lemonis said. ""People that truly want to earn it."" ",2018-01-17T18:46:00.000+02:00
1470,"Oil market on brink of correction, warns the man who called the 2015 crude collapse","If the man who called the 2015 crude collapse is right, the oil market could be the next area to see a sharp pullback.
Oil, which is seeing its best start to a year since 2006, has entered a danger zone, according to Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service.
Kloza, the firm's global head of energy analysis, made the call on CNBC's "" Futures Now "" on Tuesday just as Wall Street was coping with the stock market's worst day since last August.
""There's some collateral damage from the stock market right now. I don't believe this is the bloodletting that's due because of the tremendous speculative bubble and the money on the crude oil side,"" Kloza said. ""That will come at a later date.""
That day could be just weeks away, due to changing demand dynamics and ""swelling"" global markets, he added.
""All of the demand growth, all of it, is overseas. It's not in the United States,"" he said. ""My sense is that global markets give back some of these very, very robust financial gains.""
Brent oil has soared 97 percent and WTI crude prices are up nearly 90 percent over the past two years. Right now, Brent is trading around $68 a barrel and WTI is bouncing around $64.
Kloza is looking for an average Brent price of $59 a barrel this year and a WTI range of $54 to $56, a substantial decrease from current levels.
In a note to CNBC, Kloza wrote he ""wouldn't be surprised to see prices move below these numbers when there is some fear among the fickle financial funds that drove prices to exuberant highs. But a $15-$20 bbl drop doesn't compare to some historical declines ($111 bbl drop from the high in 2008) and the more than 50 percent drop of 2014-2015.""
The downward trend may spell bad news for Wall Street, but lower crude prices typically suggest cheaper prices at the gasoline pumps. But not in this case, warns Kloza. He's detecting a paradox emerging in the energy market.
""Just when the bubble for crude oil is deflating, you're going to see an increasing bubble for gasoline,"" Kloza said. ""And, we're facing probably the highest second quarter gasoline prices for the American consumer that we've seen since 2014.""

4799,Minimum wages for these workers haven't gone up since 1996: Here's why that's a problem,"CNBC.com Thomas Barwick | Getty Images 
Tracy Brasseur works as a waitress at Leo's Coney Island restaurant in Royal Oak, Michigan, from 6 a.m. to 2. p.m., five days a week. 
Although she only makes $3.52 an hour – the minimum wage for ""tipped"" workers in the state – she was bringing home around $500 each week, thanks to those gratuities. 
But lately, things have been tighter for the 46-year-old mother of two. 
A construction project near her restaurant has resulted in fewer customers coming through the door. Her wages for full-time work have shriveled to around $250 a week. 
""My landlord doesn't care that we have construction behind the restaurant,"" Brasseur said. ""They want their rent money."" 
Advocates and workers recently celebrated the Department of Labor's decision to back off its proposal to allow employers to use certain workers' tips. 
The updated law now allows that tips get shared among non-tipped workers, like cooks and dishwashers. But it doesn't cover managers or employers, and it applies only if all workers are paid the regular minimum wage of that region — not the lower hourly compensation paid to some tipped workers. 
Now labor advocates are focused on a more familiar fight: Abolishing the tipped wage altogether. While the federal minimum wage has been inching up over the last few decades, the federal minimum wage for tipped workers has been frozen at $2.13 since 1996. 
Some states have raised the tipped wage beyond that, but only seven states guarantee the same minimum wage to all workers. 
All over the country, people are working on the One Fair Wage campaign. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this year that he's holding hearings on eliminating the lower hourly wage for tipped workers. Michigan and Washington D.C . are also considering establishing one minimum wage for all workers. 
""We haven't had this happening before,"" said Sylvia A. Allegretto, an economist and chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said the tipped wage is a fair practice. 
""Servers frequently make much more than the minimum wage based upon their level of service,"" Simpson said. 
However, critics of the so-called two-tiered wage system argue that it exposes tipped workers to disproportionate levels of poverty and financial uncertainty. 
While many people might think of a tipped worker in a high-end establishment, frequently picking up $20 bills at the end of a meal, the vast majority of restaurant workers are employed at larger chains, like Denny's and Applebee's, across the country. 
Almost 13 percent of tipped workers are in poverty, compared with around 6 percent of non-tipped employees, according to a 2014 joint report by the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
These problems are likely to be exacerbated by the fact that more workers will be making their living in restaurants. While employment in the private sector grew by 33 percent from 1990 to 2016, the number of full service restaurant workers doubled, according to Allegretto. 
The Department of Labor projects food and beverage related jobs to grow by 14 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. 
""These jobs are becoming more plentiful, they're becoming a bigger part of our total economy,"" Allegretto said. ""We have to take a hard look at bringing up not just the pay, but the quality of these jobs."" When your paycheck is a question mark Source: Erik Gullbeg Erik Gullbeg, a waiter in New York City 
Unlike most other employees, what tipped workers take home from one week to the next can vary dramatically, based on factors outside of their control. That includes the weather, or whether their boss schedules them during the slow or busy shifts. 
""That shift where you're raking it in, when combined with other shifts where you're struggling to make it, mean that you have irregular and unpredictable earnings,"" said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. 
All workers receive around $16 an hour, compared with just about $10 an hour for tipped workers, according to the report by Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
""I can never be sure what my paycheck is going to be at the end of the week,"" said Erik Gullberg, a waiter and bartender at a restaurant in the East Village section of Manhattan in New York City. 
""One bad Saturday night can throw off the whole week and I basically know I'm only eating at the restaurant."" 'Well then go find another place to work' Source: Tracy Brasseur Tracy Brasseur in her work uniform 
Under federal law, workers who are paid the tipped wage must end up with at least the minimum wage after tips. 
However, advocates and workers say this often doesn't happen. 
""If you don't make enough in tips it's an awkward situation for the employee to go the employer and say, 'I'm not getting the full minimum wage. I need you to follow the law',"" said Shierholz, at the Economic Policy Institute. 
The Department of Labor's wage and hour division found that between 2010 and 2012, more than 80 percent of the full-service restaurants it investigated had some type of violation. 
Even for workers who do confront their bosses, problems remain. 
""They're not receptive at all,"" said Brasseur, the waitress in Michigan, speaking about confrontations she's had throughout the decades she's waited tables. 
""I've had bosses go ahead and say, 'Well then go find another place to work."" Another line she's heard: ""We're not making much money either."" Living without a safety net Source: Kirsti Esch Kirsti Esch, who's been a waitress in New York City for five years 
""Being able to take care of yourself and use benefits is impossible if you're relying on tips,"" said Saru Jayaraman , president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a worker advocacy group. 
Although about 70 percent of the overall private workforce is offered health insurance, just 30 percent of food and service workers are, according to the EPI report. Around 64 percent of those private-sector workersreceive retirement benefits, compared with just 27 percent of food and service workers. 
""The idea of retirement is entirely foreign to me,"" said Gullberg, the waiter in New York City. ""Everyone in the restaurant industry lives paycheck to paycheck."" 
Just 23 percent of food service workers are compensated if they're too ill to work. 
Kirsti Esch, a waitress in New York City, says she can't afford to take a day off, even if she is ill. 
""I can't remember the last time I've actually taken a sick day,"" said Esch, 29. ""You have to go in.""

4070,Trump-allied America First Policies spends big on polling. Here are 24 of their internal reports,"As CNBC reported Thursday, the pro-Trump dark money group America First Policies is conducting a large-scale polling operation that one expert called ""a shadow campaign"" for President Donald Trump.
The group initially claimed to CNBC that it tries to make its polling information available on its website whenever possible. But after CNBC's story ran, America First Policies removed all but three of the 14 reports that had previously been hidden in plain sight, behind an inconspicuous button at the bottom of America First Policies' website.
Many of these documents are still available online, however, as are several America First Policies reports and polls dating back to June 2017, and covering nearly every major issue that has crossed the president's desk over the past six months.
CNBC has compiled the best of these reports below, starting with the most recent. Taken together, they offer a unique window into what this shadowy pro-Trump group knows about the president's priorities, about voters like you, and about the long-term direction of the Trump agenda.
FEBRUARY National Poll Survey Results 
This 17-page series of questions and answers is filled with interesting details from the current news cycle, as well a few worrisome signs about how tax reform is playing out among voters, and what the public thinks of Trump's handling of White House personnel issues. On those two topics alone, America FIrst Policies learned that A) only 41 percent of Americans know anyone who has benefited personally from the tax reform bill, and that B) not even a leading question can make Americans approve of Trump's response to the resignation of Rob Porter.
National Poll Results Report 
This document may not appear at first, but it's an 84-page slide presentation that contains the same data as the survey, only easier to understand and more compelling in color. It can be downloaded via the Download button as a Keynote file, then converted to PDF using either an iPhone, iPad or Mac.
JANUARY Immigration Memo 
This memo sums up the immigration-related results of the December national survey. They reflect, among other things, continued public skepticism that building a wall on the southern border is the right way to protect America from undocumented immigration. For a fuller picture of these findings, see the December National Results file, below.
National Trends Among Women 
This 16-page polling report surveys the state of female electorate, and specifically how women respond to Trump and the GOP. Its overarching recommendation? Republicans should pass some token bipartisan legislation in Congress to help them win the support of women on other, more ""important,"" issues.
Paid Family Leave Survey Results 
This survey shows overwhelming support for mandatory paid maternity leave, and even more support when companies providing that leave get tax breaks for it. If the White House is, in fact, looking for an issue that could help Republicans win support among women, this could be it.
""Fire and Fury"" Report 
When Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury"" first came out in January, the Trump team conducted a flash report on how the media was reacting to the White House response. The day this report was conducted, Trump's lawyers were working furiously to keep the book, and its embarrassing revelations about Trump, off the shelves.
DACA Negotiations Report 
America First Policies did another snap report in mid-January on how the media and influencers were responding to Trump's role in the negotiations over a government shutdown and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
DECEMBER December National Results 
This 55-page report contains the results of America First Policies' large national poll from early December. Along with data on immigration reform and infrastructure, it shows that more than two months before this week's tariff announcements, the Trump team was already concerned with Trump's low approval numbers for his handling of ""trade deals."" At the time they wrote, ""Note the positive correlation that the President has with the stock market's gains. We might be able to tie this in to his handling of the economy in general and trade deals in particular to grow those attributes as well.""
Raw December Results Plus Six Months of Comparison Data 
These are the survey questions, marked ""Confidential,"" that America First Policies pollsters asked voters in December. Just as importantly, included here are six months of results for the questions they asked in every poll, such as Trump's approval ratings or their impressions of both Democratic and Republican political figures. Noteworthy: More than a year after the 2016 presidential election, Trump pollsters were still asking voters about Hillary Clinton.
Jerusalem Embassy Announcement 
This snap report in December gauged media and influencers' responses to Trump's announcement that the U.S. would move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. One interesting finding: The report notes that former Obama ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro ""would serve as a valuable potential advisor to the President.""
NOVEMBER Alabama Research Memo and Alabama Voter Survey 
In mid-November, the White House and congressionals Republicans were reeling after The Washington Post reported on allegations that Republican Alabama Senate Nominee Roy Moore had engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with teenagers when he was in his thirties.
America First Policies polled the race then, and the results were troubling. Voters knew about the allegations, and Democrat Doug Jones was forecast to win against Moore and every Republican write-in prospect they polled, save for Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Alabama Nov. 29 Confidential Survey 
Two weeks later, a second AFP poll showed Moore even with Democrat Doug Jones. After weeks of waffling, Trump formally endorsed Moore a few days after that poll, on December 4, a move that triggered the RNC to begin pumping money into Moore's race. Moore lost.
North Korea Terror Announcement 
When Trump announced that he would designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, in November, something perplexed the team at America First Policies: Why this announcement got more retweets than Trump's declaration of a public health emergency for the opioid crisis. ""Overall, the topic has played well for the President even though he did not publish any tweets about the designation,"" reads this Nov. 21 report.
OCTOBER Analysis of 3-Part Tax Reform Testing 
This October report reveals results from two kinds of surveys that America First Policies doesn't always use, but which it used this fall to conduct research on tax reform: A focus group of Trump voters and separate polling in red states and blue states. Among other things, Trump voters told researchers they did not approve of Trump's attacks on the National Football League: ""I don't want to decide whether or not I like football or not,"" said a participant named Eric.
SEPTEMBER Tax Reform Results 
This 43-page visual report from September contains fascinating clues to many of the building blocks that helped Republicans sell tax reform over the next three months, from testing who voters thought was to blame for their dissatisfaction with the tax system, to testing how well voters like lines from Trump speeches.
GOP Tax Plan Announcement 
This flash survey from the days around Trump's Sept. 29 release of the GOP tax reform plan gave the Trump team a sense of how far they still had to go to sell the tax plan to the public. According to the report, ""22% of the conversation volume stated that the Tax Reform plan benefits the wealthy and will result in the ""rich getting richer."" Less than 1% of conversation volume described the plan as a ""middle class miracle.""
AUGUST National Immigration Reform Poll Results 
This 34-page series of results from an August poll offered a first glimpse of what would become large parts of the Trump administration's plan for immigration reform. For example, there was strong support for the line, ""We should first secure our borders before passing any immigration reforms,"" which was used frequently last fall. But support was weakest for arguments that were cultural, such as ""Immigration is occurring too much and changing American culture and values in a way I don't like.""
National Tax Reform Focus Groups Analysis 
Also in August, focus groups were helping to inform White House and congressional Republican talking points on tax reform. Here's one example in this report: ""For filing your taxes, a simple page of paper works, a postcard does not."" Participants didn't believe the long-held GOP mantra that you could file your taxes on a postcard. Soon after, Trump started talking about a single sheet of paper, not a postcard.
Trump Announcement of Afghanistan Strategy 
This flash report on media and influencers' responses to Trump's Aug. 21 speech on U.S. Afghanistan strategy shows how carefully America First Policies is tracking positive, negative and neutral responses to the president across media platforms. Here, they note that conservative outlets aren't being as friendly as usual to the president.
Trump's Handling of Hurricane Harvey 
This flash media in late August tracked and catalogued the reactions of influential people and news outlets to Trump's handling of Hurricane Harvey during its first few days after making landfall in Texas. The findings are unsurprising, but the specificity of these reports, and how carefully they measure every tweet, is fascinating.

Here, they note that conservative outlets aren't being as friendly as usual to the president.
JUNE Tax Reform Poll Results 
This poll was one of the earliest tax reform polls conducted by America First Policies, back in June. It contains examples of messages that could have been used to sell tax reform, but were ultimately not employed by the White House, like this one: Tax reform will ""Make it easier to pay for college by streamlining the maze of education tax benefits.""
Health Care Poll Results 
As the push to repeal Obamacare was reaching its apex, America First Policies commissioned this poll to test both messaging and positions on the Affordable Care Act. What they learned cannot have come as good news: Only 28 percent of voters, or less than a third supported the full repeal of Obamacare that Republicans were trying to pass.",2018-03-02T22:54:00.000+02:00
5308,How to land a job at Tesla,"Last year, Tesla received nearly 500,000 applications for just 2,500 open positions . That means the chances of getting a job at Tesla is just 0.005 percent, making the sustainable car manufacturer more exclusive than any college in the world.
Despite the avalanche of applications, Tesla still manages to review every single application.
""It is painstaking, because we really don't want people to feel like they're going into a black hole, so we do go through all of those applications,"" Cindy Nicola, Tesla's head of global recruiting, tells CNBC Make It . ""It isn't easy. But to be honest, we're super excited and want to be respectful of the fact that people are interested in Tesla.""
Nicola oversees Tesla's recruiting efforts for ""basically anyone, from interns to executives."" She says that even though no two applicants are the same, there are several things that Tesla employees have in common. 

If you want to get a job at Tesla , here are three things to keep in mind:
Courtesy of Tesla Two Tesla START students. 1. Love the mission Something that sets Tesla — and Tesla employees — apart is a dedication to the company's founding mission ""to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.""
In order to prove that they are the perfect fit for Tesla, applicants need to demonstrate that they are passionate about this mission.
""We are extremely mission-driven. There's a lot of energy in the world around what we're trying to do. We have really tough problems to solve, so I think people want to be a part of that,"" says Nicola. ""There's not many companies that you can work at today where there's really a direct impact between the work you do and changing the world.""

Demonstrate your 'DNA' At Tesla, the application process is tailored for each specific position. ""One of the things that is unique about the way I run my business is that we do not have a cookie-cutter approach,"" says Nicola. ""So we shy away from kind of that one-size-fits-all approach.""
It's crucial that applicants understand precisely what skills the role requires and demonstrate the character to excel in the job, and at Tesla. Applicants should reach out to someone who holds a similar position and do their research about the characteristics that the company values. 
""There's four main principles that are important at Tesla — being innovative, driven, collaborative and trustworthy,"" says Nicola. ""It really is important for us to preserve the culture that we do have, and to design assessment processes that are making sure that people have the right DNA to be successful at Tesla.""
To get a job at Tesla, applicants need to demonstrate that they possess these qualities. Using examples from previous work experience, bringing a portfolio of your work or highlighting a specific reference can help you show that you have the character that they are looking for.
Courtesy of Tesla and Alexis Georgeson A Tesla service center 3. Show, don't tell ""We are big believers in showing us what you can do, versus telling us what you can do,"" says Nicola. ""So for example, if you were an engineering candidate and you were coming in, there might be some coding test or some problem solving that we would do on a whiteboard.""
During these exercises, Tesla is assessing a candidates competency as well as their problem-solving process.
""We are looking for people that are comfortable with ambiguity,"" says Nicola. ""What we are doing here is really hard, it's never been done before, there's not always an instant right answer, so when we are doing those problem-solving exercises we are actually looking for how people think and how they approach problems, versus having the perfect answer.""
Candidates should make an effort to explain their thought process to interviewers. By talking about how you're approaching a difficult problem, applicants can demonstrate that they are comfortable with tricky problem solving and can show off their communication abilities.
If you do manage to score a job at Tesla, congratulations! Buckle up for quite a ride. As Nicola says, ""Our growth has been incredible and exponential — and there's no end in sight.""

3343,Trump has already given Kim Jong Un 'everything he wants',"On Thursday, President Donald Trump accepted an invitation to meet face-to-face with North Korea 's leader, Kim Jong Un . Given the fiery tone of Trump's earlier statements, and his repeated demands that North Korea would have to abandon its nuclear ambitions as a precondition to negotiations, the news of a meeting came as a surprise to those who had taken the president at his word.
Much has been said about whether this was a wise move by Trump, what Trump might hope to accomplish with such a meeting, and whether Kim is simply setting a ""trap"" of sorts to ease sanctions on North Korea. As both a negotiation scholar, and as a negotiations advisor to organizations and governments around the globe, I'd like to highlight some important considerations that I think have been missed (or which have received only scant attention) in other analyses.
KCNA | Reuters North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un watches a military drill marking the 85th anniversary of the establishment of the Korean People's Army (KPA). In agreeing to meet with Kim Jong Un, President Trump has given the North Korean leader everything he wants. That does not necessarily translate into a complete loss for the United States—after all, this is not a zero-sum game. But to argue that Trump's acceptance is not a concession that can be exploited is to completely misunderstand the real interests of the North Korean regime.
No American president has sat down with a leader of North Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953, but the propaganda boost this meeting provides is a distant third on Kim's wish list for 2018. More problematically, Trump's move validates Kim Jong Un's claim that only a nuclear-armed North Korea will be treated with respect by the Trump administration.
""To argue that Trump's acceptance is not a concession that can be exploited is to completely misunderstand the real interests of the North Korean regime."" Trump's willingness to sit down with Kim takes on even greater significance when contrasted with Trump's aggressive treatment of Iran—a country that agreed, at the negotiation table, to halt its nuclear weapons program and accept an aggressive monitoring regime.
Neither Kim's father nor his grandfather was able to score a face-to-face with a U.S. president, and now, mere months after the North Korean government announced its ability (albeit unverified) to reach the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, President Trump has agreed to a meeting.
This amounts to tacit acceptance of North Korea's recent actions as a risk having been worth taking; it has been rewarded with what sounds awfully like a meeting between equals. The problem with this is not merely one of perception: consider how much harder it will now be for the North Koreans to accept a future without nuclear weapons. Consider also how other international actors might be tempted to rethink their own stance on nuclear weapons.
show chapters White House sets conditions for North Korea meeting 4:50 PM ET Fri, 9 March 2018 | 01:45 But President Trump's willingness to meet Kim Jong Un is an especially costly move for yet another, more imminent reason. If there was one thing that Kim wanted more this year than a propaganda win or the acceptance by Trump of North Korea as a nuclear power, it was time . This has been Kim's top priority since at least the start of 2018.
The sudden willingness to engage with South Korea, to participate in the Olympics, and to invite a delegation from the South to meet with Kim himself—all of these actions were initiated after Trump's war rhetoric reached its maximal pitch and there was the perceived risk of a preemptive attack by the United States.
The goal was to lower the temperature long enough so that things do not get out of hand before North Korea is fully prepared. Can't North Korea already retaliate militarily and cause massive damage to U.S. interests? Undoubtedly, yes. But has North Korea achieved an optimal deterrent and a second-strike capability that can effectively target the United States itself? By most accounts, it has not, and this is precisely what Kim would like to achieve before matters come to a head—either at the negotiation table or when negotiations fail.
The offer to meet a few months hence, now that it has been accepted, gives that much more time for Kim to achieve this objective. If it does not buy enough time, or if the proposed meeting gets cancelled in the coming weeks—which I consider to be a highly likely scenario—you can be sure there will be another such move by North Korea.
As a strong supporter of negotiation and diplomacy even when things seem impossible, I am in favor of creating a process (with properly curated and coordinated public and private channels) that brings the United States and North Korea to the table. The stakes are too high not to do so. However, I am confident that this could have been achieved without President Trump so enthusiastically accepting a meeting with Kim this early in the process, and it could have been done at significantly lower strategic cost.

4992,How to use social media to advance your career in 4 simple steps,"CNBC.com Nora Carol Photography | Getty 
Social media can be a welcome distraction from the daily grind of the office, but it can also be a useful tool for advancing your career — if you know how to use it. 
That doesn't just mean listing your resume on LinkedIn and or liking the same interests as your boss on Facebook . 
These days, making sure your social media profile looks and sounds professional is just the ""first step,"" according to social media management platform Hootsuite. But using it to build ""a professional brand"" could be what sets you apart. 
That can be achieved in four simple steps, Hootsuite's senior director of growth and marketing for Asia Pacific, Roger Graham, told CNBC Make It . 1. Thought leadership 
First of all, identify a niche that you want to own as a professional and start creating content to showcase it. 
""This should be where your expertise lies, or the direction that you want to take your career,"" explained Graham. 
He advised frequently talking to industry leaders and forming opinions on ""hot button topics"" impacting your industry. That will not only make you more knowledgeable about your subject area, but also help you to stand out from your peers. 2. Content curation 
Secondly, make it easy for people to follow you by coming up with a content calendar. 
Ideally, you should share posts regularly enough that people look out for them, but not so often that you risk flooding their feed. 
""This could take the form of an interesting news article, short commentary on breaking news or your own thought-leadership opinion pieces,"" Graham noted. 3. Amplification 
Next, be sure to share your work across various social media platforms. 
Not only will that allow you to target your different networks, but it will also help you expand your reach and engage with new audiences. 
If your content aligns with your organization, it may also be willing to share it, so ""keep your options open,"" suggested Graham. 4. Engagement 
Finally, don't forget that social media is about being social. 
""Feel free to engage with people's content, share their own thought-leadership pieces, and react to people engaging with you,"" explained Graham. 
""This is a crucial step in building your own network as it will help you reach out to networks outside of your own."" ",2018-04-20T04:55:00.000+03:00

559,"At Davos, CEOs must address income inequality","Global leaders of all backgrounds are gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos that began on Tuesday. Without a doubt, the business community heads in with much greater optimism than they had at least year's convening.
What a difference a year—and a global economic revival—can make to what CEOs have on their minds.
In late 2016, the dark cloud of a global recession ranked as the greatest fear of respondents to The Conference Board's annual survey of top business executives. One year later, not all CEOs have broken into a happy dance with three percent (or better) global economic growth predicted for 2018. But, the latest Conference Board C-Suite Challenge Survey shows that ""global recession"" dropped to 19th on their list of ""hot-button issues.""
Defensive tactics such as controlling baseline costs, managing currency risk, and raising capital reserves – challenges so prominent 12 months earlier – have taken a backseat to growth-oriented ones including talent, digitization, and innovation.
Moreover, the results reveal a touch of greater social consciousness in the collective minds of business leaders. Admittedly, the CEO community alone may not be able to achieve the worthy theme and goal of this year's meeting, Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World . However, in light of that theme, the findings from three survey topics should encourage executives to lead the narrative and advance solutions at this global gathering.
""This year, CEOs expressed heightened concern over the potential impact of income inequality on social and business environments."" First, growth is good, but the benefits need to be better spread around. This year, CEOs expressed heightened concern over the potential impact of income inequality on social and business environments. It has risen to seventh on our global list of hot-button issues, up from 18 th in 2017; it ranks even higher in China and the rest of emerging Asia. And chief human resource officers in our survey rank it as their fifth-highest hot-button issue.
Why does increasing concern about inequality make sense to business leaders? The potential impact of income inequality on employee engagement and morale may well have an impact on productivity. And wage increases may be needed not only to attract high-quality workers, but also to avoid a large consumer class with limited purchasing power.
Second, business leaders realize they must develop stronger and more value-driven cultures. In their eyes, achieving this requires building more engaged, productive, innovative, customer-centric and ultimately more productive, more profitable, and more socially aware organizations.
Inclusive and engaging cultures go a long way toward addressing 2018's top-voted CEO concern: the ability to attract and retain talent. The premium placed on talent comes as no surprise, since executives must navigate increasingly tight labor markets, exacerbated by a faster pace of digital transformation. In other words, what has often been seen as the ""soft stuff"" no longer seems so soft.
Third, one of the most critical themes centers on communications. Business leaders are vowing to better and more effectively communicate within their organizations - up, down, and across. Being more open, transparent, and inclusive starts at the top, and is critical to building a culture where everyone can be heard, feel safe, and have their ideas count.
When deliberating and applying their business acumen at this week's conference, business leaders might think of the Greek philosopher Plutarch as their guiding light. He once said that ""An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics.""
While Plutarch was sounding the alarm about financial inequity, a sense of inequity also extends to the workplace and the environment. Judging from this year's theme, the WEF believes creating a shared future lies within reach.
While it may not be in the sole purview of CEOs to re-unite an uncertain and fragmented world community, it is in their power to address the issues that divide their own workplaces. A commitment to inclusion, fairness, upskilling through training and development, and worker engagement would be a step in that direction.

5237,"Virgin Galactic completes first rocket powered, supersonic flight of new spacecraft Unity","CNBC.com Virgin Galactic Virgin Spaceship Unity touches down after flying freely for the first time December 3, 2016 in the Mojave Desert. 
Virgin Galactic completed its first powered flight in nearly four years on Thursday when Richard Branson's space company launched its Unity spacecraft by rocket power, reaching supersonic speeds before safely landing. @virgingalactic: VSS Unity went supersonic and will be landing shortly #SpaceShipTwo 
Unity took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port, lifted by the jet-powered mothership Eve. The carrier aircraft lifted Unity to an altitude of 46,500 feet above the desert. Eve released Unity from under its wing and, with a two-member crew of Mark Stucky and Dave Mackay, Unity's rocket motor roared to life. The rocket screamed into a steep climb as the engine burned for 30 seconds, pushing Unity past the speed of sound to Mach 1.87. 
""On rocket shutdown, Unity continued an upwards coast to an apogee of 84,271 feet before readying for the downhill return,"" Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said in a statement. 
The Unity craft the turned and glided back to land at Mojave, with Eve touching down soon after. It was the fifth powered test flight of the SpaceShipTwo design, and the first since the fatal crash of Spaceship Enterprise on Oct. 31, 2014. @virgingalactic: Touch down. Congratulations Mark ""Forger"" Stucky and Dave Mackay for a great milestone test flight #SpaceShipTwo 
The spacecraft underwent extensive engine testing and seven glide tests before Virgin Galactic said it was ready for a powered test flight — a crucial milestone before the company begins sending tourists to the edge of the atmosphere. 
The original SpaceShipTwo craft was built by experimental aircraft developer Scaled Composites. In 2016, Virgin Galactic unveiled the version of the SpaceShipTwo design on which Unity is based, built by The Spaceship Company. A subsidiary of Virgin Group, The Spaceship Company made alterations to the design, intending to avoid a repeat of the 2014 accident. The company is also building two more spaceships, intended to become part of the Virgin fleet for taking people to the edge of space. Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic Unity's seventh glide flight test in Mojave, California on Jan. 11, 2018. 
Future passengers who are willing to pay $250,000 will be taken up with help from the spacecraft's mothership. When it reaches a certain altitude, the Virgin Galactic craft will launch into space around 68 miles above the Earth's surface, before re-entering the planet's atmosphere. 
Branson's space companies recently got a boost from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , which announced intentions to invest $1 billion in Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company and Virgin Orbit. At the time of the announcement, Branson said Virgin Galactic was near its intended goal. 
""We are now just months away from Virgin Galactic sending people into space and Virgin Orbit placing satellites around the Earth,"" Branson said. WATCH: Take a look at Nat Geo's new 'Space Projection Helmets' show chapters ",2018-04-05T19:13:00.000+03:00
5215,Cambridge Analytica whistleblower says Facebook users' data could be stored in Russia,"The number of Facebook users affected by the recent data sharing scandal could exceed 87 million and records could be stored in Russia, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie said on Sunday.
Wylie said that Aleksandr Kogan, whose quiz app harvested the data of tens of millions of Facebook users, could have allowed that data to be stored in Russia. An organization run by Kogan, called Global Science Research (GSR), shared the data with controversial political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica without their permission.
""I think that there is a genuine risk that this data has been accessed by quite a few people and it could be stored in various parts of the world, including Russia, given the fact that the professor who was managing the data harvesting process was going back and forth between the U.K. and Russia at the same time that he was working for Russian-funded projects on psychological profiling,"" Wylie told NBC's Chuck Todd during a ""Meet the Press"" segment. 
""I couldn't tell you how many people had access to it, that's a question better answered by Cambridge Analytica, but I can say that various people had access to it.""
Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. CNBC also contacted Kogan's Cambridge University email address, but the academic was not available at the time of publication.
Wylie believes the total number of Facebook users whose data was shared could be even more than the 87 million admitted by Facebook last week. Initial reports by the Observer and New York Times newspapers put the figure at 50 million. Cambridge Analytica has said that it licensed no more than 30 million Facebook users from GSR.

Self-made millionaire and co-founder of AE Wealth Management David Bach started investing early: He bought his first stock at age seven. 
It's all thanks to his grandmother, Bach tells CNBC Make It : ""The best advice I ever got about money came from my Grandma Rose Bach. She helped me buy my first stock at age seven in McDonald's, and she basically taught me a lesson that changed my life."" 
She told him, ""There are three types of people in the world: Those who come to McDonald's and eat here, like you are now, and spend money; those who work here for minimum wage; and those who invest in the company. Investors get rich."" Courtesy of David Bach Self-made millionaire and bestselling author David Bach 
Bach's grandmother proceeded to help him buy his first stock and ""that experience of thinking like an investor starting at the age of seven changed my whole life,"" he says. After all, as the self-made millionaire came to learn, consistently investing a portion of your paycheck — a strategy known as paying yourself first — is the key to getting building wealth. 
""Becoming rich requires nothing more than committing and sticking to a systematic savings and investment plan,"" Bach writes in his New York Times bestseller "" The Automatic Millionaire ."" And, because of compound interest , the sooner you put your money to work, the better. 
To be clear, your investment plan shouldn't involve you trying to pick stocks individually. Bach and other experts tend to agree that you should start by investing your money in a tax-advantaged retirement account , such as a 401(k) , IRA or Roth IRA . Then, look into index funds , which offer diversity at a low cost and generally deliver good long-term returns, or robo-advisors . 
But if you're trying to get your kid hooked on investing, help them get involved at a young age, like Bach's grandmother did. ""If you can do anything with your kids, help them buy one share of stock — a company that they use and love — and teach them how to be an investor,"" Bach tells CNBC Make It.

1150,Government shutdown threats aren’t new — but this standoff is far different,"Twice under President Barack Obama , Republican lawmakers precipitated acute crises of governance. Now, as Donald Trump's Washington nears a government shutdown, Republicans accuse Democrats of doing the same thing.
The 2011 debt crisis and 2013 government shutdown bear a surface similarity to the current impasse. In the first two, a Republican-controlled House demanded policy concessions in return for raising the federal debt limit and keeping the government open; now the Democratic minority wants concessions.
But the differences in circumstances outweigh the similarities — and not just because Republican now hold undivided control of the government. In reality, Democrats are not doing the same thing.
In 2011, having won control of the House the previous November, Republicans demanded massive spending cuts as a condition of preventing a government default. By the time Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell engineered an escape strategy, the U.S. suffered the first-ever downgrade of its credit rating.
Republicans eventually forced Obama and his party to accept massive spending cuts — but those cuts proved so much deeper than American voters would support that they've been rolled back. Republican leaders themselves no longer support them.
In 2013, Republicans forced a shutdown as part of their quest to wipe out Obamacare. Since Obama remained president and Democrats still controlled the Senate, they had no prospect of success.
Nor was public consensus behind them, though overall public opinion on Obamacare was marginally negative. As the shutdown dragged on, Americans blamed Republicans more than Democrats, and Republicans eventually surrendered.
Thus Republicans had twice halted government over objectives they lacked the political support and institutional power to sustain.
The current standoff is far different.
Getty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) answers questions on the possibility of a government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on January 18, 2018 in Washington, DC. It originated with President Trump's proposal to roll back those cuts Republicans forced Democrats to accept in 2011 to provide roughly $50 billion more for the Pentagon. To offset that increase, the White House requested comparable cuts in nondefense spending.
But Republicans in Congress oppose the Republican president's requested cuts. Instead, they're negotiating with Democrats to increase nondefense spending, too.
Democrats don't control either chamber of Congress. But Republican leaders need some Democratic votes, at least in the Senate, to keep the government open. Democrats have made two major demands.
One is an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The other is continued protection from deportation for the so-called dreamers in Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Polls show strong public support for both.
On Capitol Hill, CHIP has enjoyed bipartisan backing throughout its two-decade existence; Republican leaders themselves have vowed to extend it. Trump says he, like Democrats, wants to protect the dreamers so long as senators from both parties reach a bipartisan compromise on some other immigration issues.
Senators reached that bipartisan compromise. But Trump is now rejecting it.
That's why Democratic senators — and some Republicans — have so far withheld votes needed to prevent a shutdown.
In other words, Republicans in 2011 and 2013 withheld votes in pursuit of goals that were divisive, partisan and quixotic. Democrats are withholding votes now in pursuit of popular goals embraced by both parties.
That reflects a core difference between the two parties. Overwhelmingly reliant on white voters, Republicans are more homogenous and ideologically zealous. Democrats are more diverse and interested in compromise.
The rank-and-file in both parties like it that way. In a 2014 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that followed the Obama-era crises, Democrats said by 62 percent to 32 percent they preferred congressional candidates who would compromise. By 54 percent to 38 percent, Republicans preferred candidates who would stick to their positions.
Last October, when the NBC/WSJ poll asked the same question, Democrats responded the same way. Republicans' preference for hard-line views had slightly diminished amid the turbulence of Trump's opening months.
With a shutdown looming Saturday if the Senate fails to approve a temporary government funding bill, those divergent preferences pose a problem for Republicans in November's midterm elections. On a desire for compromise, independent voters side with Democrats.",2018-01-19T14:50:00.000+02:00

""Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta,"" he writes. Lacy O'Toole | CNBC Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. 
Warren Buffett believes investors do not need to be brilliant to do well in the financial markets. 
The Oracle of Omaha made a winning 10-year bet with Protégé Partners in Dec. 2007 that the S&P 500 would outperform a basket of fund of hedge funds. 
But perhaps more interesting than how a simple index fund beat out some of the brightest Wall Street minds is what Buffett did with the initial proceeds for the bet. 
He explained in his 2017 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders released on Saturday how he turned his $318,250 outlay for the bet into $2.2 million for the Girls Inc. of Omaha charity. 
""Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta,"" he wrote. ""What investors then need instead is an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to look unimaginative for a sustained period – or even to look foolish – is also essential."" 
Buffett and Protégé both purchased a face amount of $500,000 in zero-coupon Treasury bonds that cost each of them $318,250 to fund the bet ten-years ago, according to the letter. If the bonds were held to maturity, the investments would have earned a 4.56 percent annual return and equaled $1 million to the winner's charity after ten-years. 
""After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012, our bonds – now with about five years to go before they matured – were selling for 95.7% of their face value. At that price, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1%. Or, to be precise, .88%,"" he wrote. ""Given that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb – a really dumb – investment compared to American equities."" 
Buffett noted how the annual dividend yield of the S&P 500 at the time was 2.5 percent or about triple the yield of their Treasury bonds. 
As a result, Buffett and Protégé agreed in 2012 to sell the bond positions and use the money to buy 11,200 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class B stock for the remaining five years of the bet. 
The equity investment increased in value to $2.2 million, which was presented to Girls Inc. of Omaha this year.",2018-02-24T22:32:00.000+02:00
5949,Opposition mounting to CIA Director Mike Pompeo's bid to become Secretary of State,"Despite having carried out a secret diplomatic meeting in North Korea , Mike Pompeo is facing challenges at home in becoming America's next top diplomat.
Pompeo is a hard-line Republican, former businessman turned politician and President Donald Trump's pick to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of State. Ahead of his nomination, Pompeo served as CIA director and delivered Trump's intelligence briefing nearly every day. He has been Quote: d saying that the president "" asks really hard questions .""
Pompeo, 54, now waits for the 51 U.S. Senate votes that he needs in order to be confirmed as the country's top diplomat.
Earlier this week, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he hopes to hold a vote as early as next week.
Currently, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican on the committee who has announced that he will not vote in favor of Pompeo.
Paul said Pompeo's support for the Iraq War and enhanced interrogation techniques were in contradiction to the Trump administration.
""I'm perplexed by the nomination of people who love the Iraq War so much that they would advocate for a war with Iran next,"" Paul said last month. ""It goes against most of the things President Trump campaigned on, that the unintended consequences of regime change in Iraq led to instability in the Middle East.""
If Paul does not change his position, Pompeo would be short of the votes needed to win the recommendation from the Foreign Relations Committee, which means he'd need Democrats to step up.
But there have yet to be any Democrats to come out in his favor.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said that Democrats were operating under ""blind partisanship.""
""It's no good thing though to continue to have an electoral grudge when you're talking about foreign policy and national security,"" Cotton said. ""If anything they [Democrats] should want to have a professional like Mike Pompeo as the Secretary of State representing the United States interests abroad.""
The math for Pompeo to be confirmed as Secretary of State Notably, Pompeo can still be confirmed by the full Senate without support from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
However, that would make him the first nominee, at least since votes were made public in 1925, to not win the panel's favorable recommendation.
Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, became the latest member of the committee to announce his opposition to the appointment. The senator from New Jersey also criticized Pompeo for failing to disclose his recent trip to North Korea in meetings with lawmakers.
""I believe our nation's top diplomat must be forthright, and more critically his past sentiments did not reflect our nation's values and are not acceptable for our nation's top diplomat,"" Menendez said Wednesday at a discussion at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""Which is why ... I'll be casting a 'no' vote for Director Pompeo to be our secretary of state,"" he said.
Currently, there are only two senators on the committee that have not publicly shared their upcoming decision in confirming Pompeo. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said he wants to speak once more with Pompeo before voting. Likewise, Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware is also undecided.
Meanwhile, here's a breakdown of the senators for Pompeo's nomination:

116,"Trump’s offshore drilling plan ‘juices up’ the Democrats in upcoming elections, says expert","U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to open nearly all federal waters to offshore drilling has fired up many Democrats and could very well backfire in upcoming congressional elections, according to an expert.
""This just juices up the Democratic base,"" Peter Trubowitz, professor of international relations and director of the United States Center at the London School of Economics, told CNBC on Friday.
Trump's plan, presented by the Department of the Interior in a draft proposal on Thursday, would offer offshore blocks to oil and gas drillers in practically the entire U.S. outer continental shelf, opening the door to drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
The drilling proposal has triggered significant opposition from Democratic leaders and environmentalists in particular, but has garnered Republican criticism as well.
Governor Rick Scott of Florida and Larry Hogan of Maryland, both Republicans, have urged Trump to remove their states from consideration. Hogan vowed to oppose the plan ""to the fullest extent that is legally possible.""
Additionally, more than 60 environmental groups have denounced the plan. Many industry groups, meanwhile, are praising the decision.
show chapters Trump's offshore drilling plan just juices up the Democratic base: Expert 13 Hours Ago | 00:29 With both parties gearing up for what are set to be fiercely competitive midterm elections in November 2018, this will likely give further motivation to Democrats to mobilize votes across states where competition will be tight, and particularly in coastal states like Florida.
According to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the draft proposal offers about 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf for leasing, representing the largest lease sale in history . This sharply reverses an Obama administration ban on drilling in much of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, which was meant to be indefinite.
Zinke added that while the proposal has been put forth, ""nothing is final yet.""
The move is the latest by Trump to continue delivering on his campaign promise to roll back Obama-era policies and dismantle government regulation through executive orders. ""That doesn't require congressional support,"" Trubowitz said. ""He could move unilaterally, that seems from day one to have been the strategy.""",2018-01-05T11:07:00.000+02:00
740,Peter Thiel has made an offer to purchase Gawker: Report,"CNBC Peter Thiel, American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and hedge fund manager. 
Venture capitalist Peter Thiel has made an offer for Gawker, hoping to overcome legal hurdles and rival bidders for the online news site the billionaire helped shutter by funding litigation against it, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Gawker, which has been inactive for more than a year, is conducting an auction of its remaining assets, including its domain names and nearly 200,000 archived articles. Most of its assets, including its sister pages Deadspin, a sports site, and Jezebel, a feminist blog, were bought in 2016 for $135 million by media company Univision Holdings Inc . 
Thiel has not said why he wants Gawker, though the potential acquisition would let him take down stories regarding his personal life that are still available on the website, and remove the scope for further litigation between him and Gawker. Thiel, who is Facebook Inc's first major investor and a co-founder of payment service PayPal Inc, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Gawker's bankruptcy plan administrator Will Holden, of consulting firm Dacarba LLC, and the website's bankruptcy attorney Gregg Galardi, of law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, have tried to block Thiel's bid, according to court papers. 
Galardi in late November asked a U.S. bankruptcy court judge to deny Thiel's request to bid, according to court papers. He also argued Thiel is ""not a 'proper' purchaser"" because he could end up as the target of litigation, according to court papers. 
Thiel funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker after the site published a sex tape featuring Hogan. The former wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against the site, and later settled for $31 million. 
Gawker in 2007 published a story about Thiel's homosexuality. 
Multiple bidders have submitted offers for the site, Holden said in a phone interview on Thursday. Holden will choose a winner as soon as this month, and then request approval for the deal from a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, the sources said. If Holden excludes Thiel's bid, Thiel could ask the judge to consider it if it is higher than rival offers. 
The value of Thiel's bid could not be learned, though the sources said Gawker is only now worth a few million dollars. 
Kevin Lee, the co-founder and executive chairman of Didit, a marketing firm, said he also submitted a bid, without disclosing its value. If successful, Lee said, he plans to use the site to raise money for readers' preferred charities. 
The terms of the Univision sale restrict new articles from being published on Gawker until March 9. 
A group of former Gawker employees this week abandoned their effort to bid, one of the sources said. They had launched a campaign seeking $500,000 in donations through fundraising site Kickstarter, but failed to reach their goal and have returned the approximately $90,000 they did collect.

The duo behind Solemates, the shoe accessory company, is changing the world for women with their innovative high heel protectors.
Solemates spawned from a class project at Columbia Business School, and has since taken on a life of its own. Before the duo appeared on ""Shark Tank"" their yearly sales topped $1 million; since then, business has only gotten better.
Brown said that Solemates ""recently rolled out to 4,000 CVS Stores as a part of their new 'Fabulous Fashion Extras,' and are also sold by their checkout in another 5,000 CVS Stores."" Solemates has also added shoe fresheners, and a blister relief balm to their high heel empire.
Increased sales and an expanded product line would be good news for any entrepreneur. However, Ferguson said those successes surprisingly aren't the highlight of their Shark Tank experience.
She explained: ""...It has put us in a unique group of Shark Tank Alums. We found ourselves in ongoing dialogues with many other brands that were on the show and we are constantly sharing resources, best practices and bouncing ideas off of each other. It's been an unexpected and awesome perk.""

6070,Your credit score may have just jumped. Here's why,"1:13 PM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 00:51
Effective immediately, some consumers may have a higher credit score.
Because of improved standards for utilizing new and existing public records , the three major credit reporting companies are now excluding all tax liens from credit reports. That means some scores will head higher, for some by as much as 30 points.
Credit scores, notably those from FICO, one of the largest credit scoring companies, usually range from 300 to 850. A good score generally is above 700, and those over 760 are considered excellent.
Credit reporting and scores play a key role in most Americans' daily life. The process can determine the interest rate a consumer is going to pay for credit cards, car loans and mortgages — or whether they will get a loan at all.
The actions come following a study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that found problems with credit reporting and recommended changes to help consumers. (Incorrect information on a credit report is the top issue reported by consumers, according to the bureau.)
Last July, credit reporting companies removed nearly 100 percent of civil judgment data and about 50 percent of tax lien data from credit reports. Now they have removed the rest. The latest change took effect last month.
As a result, LexisNexis Risk Solutions predicts that about 11 percent of the population had a judgment or lien removed from their credit file, according to the company's own estimate.
Once that information is stripped out, credit scores could go up by as much as 30 points overall, LexisNexis found. LexisNexis also provides lenders with data to make decisions on consumer loans.
Other industry groups have said these changes will have less of an impact.
""Analyses conducted by the credit reporting agencies and credit score developers FICO and VantageScore show only modest credit scoring impacts,"" Eric Ellman, a senior vice president of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a statement when the changes were first announced. The association represents Equifax , Experian and TransUnion , the three largest credit reporting companies.
A follow-up report by the CFPB found that only a small number of consumers who had civil judgments or tax liens removed from their reports in July experienced a jump significant enough to improve their credit profile.
For consumers who are not directly affected by the change, there could be consequences as well.
If banks are less able to differentiate a risky borrower from a nonrisky borrower, ""lenders and servicers have to hedge for that risk,"" said Nick Larson, a business development manager for the financial services unit of LexisNexis Risk Solutions.
As a result, lenders will have to charge higher interest rates across the board, he said. ""Overall, consumers actually get hurt.""

5177,"Syria, Middle East tensions pose bigger risk for oil prices","Market Insider Syria, Middle East tensions pose bigger risk for oil prices Oil prices rose the most in two weeks Monday, as President Donald Trump mulled a response to a Syrian chemical attack, but crude still reflects very little geopolitical risk. Oil futures also jumped as trade war fears subsided. Traders said any U.S. countermeasure would not likely affect any oil supplies. John Bolton began his tenure as national security adviser Monday, and analysts expect the hawkish former U.N. Ambassador to influence the president to be more assertive in Middle East policy. CNBC.com Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images John Bolton, national security advisor, listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, April 9, 2018. 
Oil prices rose the most in two weeks Monday, as President Donald Trump mulls a response to a Syrian chemical attack, but crude still reflects very little geopolitical risk. 
Earlier Monday, Trump, flanked by John Bolton, his new, hawkish national security adviser, promised a ""major decision"" on Syria over the next 24 to 48 hours. Analysts said they expect whatever the response, it will be focused strictly on Syria and would not affect oil supplies. 
The incident is the latest in the region to spill into the oil market after the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen attacked a Saudi oil tanker last week, one in a series of recent attacks on Saudi Arabia. However, analysts say the market is currently only reflecting $2 to $3 of geopolitical risk. 
""I don't think this becomes an event that limits physical supply from the region, but there are risks,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodities research at TD Securities. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $63.42, a gain of 2.2 percent Monday. 
Both Syria's government and Russia denied involvement in the Saturday night attack that killed at least 60 and wounded more than 1,000 in Douma. However, both accused Israel of carrying out attacks the following day on a Syrian air base, killing at least 14 people, including Iranian personnel. 
""The market seems to be moving on the trade war story. I think the Middle East stories are important,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC. ""Syria is the trip wire for an Israel, Iran conflict, and Yemen is the trip wire for Saudi, Iran."" 
Melek said he only expects oil to move slightly higher, possibly to where it will hit resistance at $64.12 per barrel. That would not add much more than the current $3 geopolitical risk premium unless the activity in the Middle East gets more heated or disrupts oil supply. 
Croft said one reason oil prices are not moving that much is the sense that the U.S. as an oil producer can add to world supply if there is a disruption. 
""Do people really think about what a broader Middle East conflict means for oil?"" said Croft, adding at another time oil prices might be flying. 
""This is the world that shale has wrought, in that shale has become the ultimate spare supply in the market and shale could plug any supply gap."" However, Croft said the market could be wrong because the output from shale drilling may not be as sustainable as expected. 
John Kilduff, energy analyst with Again Capital, said the U.S. response may carry more risk now that Bolton is in the White House. 
Bolton, former U.N. ambassador, has said the U.S. should act pre-emptively against Iran and North Korea because of their nuclear programs. Bolton is expected to encourage Trump to exit the nuclear agreement with Iran and attempt to reinstate sanctions on the country. 
Trump on Monday said he was meeting with military advisers to determine who was responsible— Syria's government, Iran, Russia, or all three. 
""Trump was obviously calling out [Russia President Vladimir] Putin and Iran, so it's good timing on Bolton's part,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Bolton's first day on the job was Monday. 
""We will see right away how forward leading he's going to be. This could be a sign of things to come,"" said Kilduff. 
The war in Yemen is viewed as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which backs the Houthi rebels. In recent weeks, there have been missile strikes from Yemen, including several aimed at Riyadh. On a recent weekend, seven missiles were interecepted by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman led the kingdom into the regional war after the Houthi rebels forced Yemen's president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. The crown prince has been away for several weeks, visiting the U.S. and now France. 
There was speculation the prince would order a retaliation for the missile attacks once he returns. Kilduff said Israel could also become more aggressive against activity in Syria. 
""This is part of their beef. They don't want Iran on their doorstep. It's a a preview of the growing worries of what could happen with this Israeli-Saudi alliance that has emerged,"" he said. 
Kilduff said the U.S. response to Syria could temporarily send oil several dollars higher, but in the unlikely event it expands beyond Syria it could be worth another $10 or more. 
"" The interesting question is what happens in Syria? Does what happens in Syria stay in Syria. With the strikes that happened on Sunday, are we going to see Israel become more confrontational? The question is contagion,"" said Croft. ""Will it stay within Syria or will it spill outside the border. Yemen is already spilling outside the border, with the attacks on Saudi Arabia. You get a fear factor, and the fact that we have these two raging proxy wars in the Middle East, and oil doesn't move on it.""",2018-04-09T23:31:00.000+03:00
3675,GOP Rep. Brady predicts the US will stay in NAFTA because the 'stakes are so high',"House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , just back from NAFTA talks in Mexico, said Tuesday he believes the United States will not scrap the trade agreement.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if negotiators from the U.S., Canada and Mexico can't figure out how to overhaul the 1994 pact.
""The stakes are so high here,"" said Brady, who has been involved in a dozen free trade negotiations ""in one way or another."" He led a bipartisan delegation to Mexico to meet with NAFTA negotiators during the past two days.
In an interview on CNBC's "" Squawk Box ,"" the Texas Republican said negotiators are making ""good progress"" and they're ""close on some major economic wins."" He added that he didn't see anything while visiting the U.S. negotiating team to make him believe the U.S. would abandon NAFTA.
Trump's announcement on Thursday of plans to impose broad import tariffs on steel and aluminum has added a layer of complication to the NAFTA talks. The stock market was slammed on Thursday and Friday on fears of a trade war. But Monday and early Tuesday, some of those concerns abated.
On Sunday, Brady said all fairly traded steel and aluminum — especially from Canada and Mexico — should be excluded from the tariffs.
While there's been no confirmation from the White House on whether such exemptions are in the works, the president this week signaled that could happen if a new, ""fair"" NAFTA can be reached.

Trump also said Monday he would stick to his tariff plan despite growing pressure from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Paul Ryan . Ryan's home state of Wisconsin would be hit by proposed European counter-measures on Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson.
Meanwhile, there's speculation that Trump may consider additional tariffs on cars imports. European automakers are urging the president to abandon thoughts of imposing a retaliatory tax on vehicles coming into the U.S. from the European Union .
TRUMP Tweet 3
""This may well be a negotiating approach"" on the part of the president,"" Brady told CNBC on Tuesday. But he added that Trump is right to want to level the playing field in the steel and aluminum industries, which are rife with unfair trading terms for U.S. producers.
The House Ways and Means chairman, first elected to Congress in 1996, has had a pretty good track record predicting tricky outcomes lately, considering he kept saying against what looked like long odds at many stages that GOP tax reform would pass.
As the top tax writer in the House, he took the lead in crafting and pushing through the new Republican tax law that overhauls the brackets for individuals and cuts the rate for U.S. corporations.

830,Billionaire Mark Cuban does these 4 things every morning,"Billionaire and ABC ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban is a successful tech entrepreneur and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. He's also almost 60.
But he hasn't used his success or his age as reasons to rest on his laurels. 
""Every morning, I am rising, I am grinding, I am learning,"" says Cuban in a video he tweeted to promote fellow ""Shark Tank"" star Daymond John's new book, "" Rise and Grind: Outperform, Outwork, and Outhustle Your Way to a More Successful and Rewarding Life. ""
4 things my man billionaire businessman @mcuban does EVERY morning. 
Here are the four things Mark Cuban, currently worth $3.3 billion according to Forbes, does every morning.
1. Start the day with a positive attitude ""My rise and grind is to get up every morning knowing how I am going to kick everybody's a--, first of all, and then get after it,"" Cuban says.
The Pittsburgh native grew up in a working class family. His father installed upholstery in cars and his mom worked any number of odd jobs. But he's always had a can-do attitude, he says.
""People thought I might go work at a mill. My mom wanted me to learn how to lay carpet because she was concerned about my future.
""Nobody had high hopes for me,"" Cuban says in an interview on ""Shark Tank."" ""But I was a hustler.""

Cuban conducts almost all his business over email .
""No meetings or phone calls unless I'm picking up a check. Everything is email,"" Cuban tells Thrive Global's Arianna Huffington . ""Love it. Live on it. Saves me hours and hours every day. No meetings. No phone calls. All because of email. I set my schedule.""
That's important to Cuban because the entrepreneur considers time the most valuable resource. ""You can't buy it. You can't find it. You can't store it. You can't trade it,"" Cuban tells Huffington .
3. Get up to speed on current events ""Then, I will catch up on all the news.""
Cuban tweets regularly about current events, and for a time, was on a short list of potential presidential candidates for 2020.
""If I was single, I would do it. For sure,"" says Cuban, during a court-side interview at a Mavericks team practice in October.

""Then, I start reading. Right now I am learning all about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, that is the wave of the future. So when I have a topic that I think I need to get up to speed on to stay ahead of everybody,"" he reads about it.
Cuban says the first trillionaire will be an AI entrepreneur and everybody should be educating themselves on the topic.
""Whatever you are studying right now if you are not getting up to speed on deep learning, neural networks, etc., you lose,"" says Cuban, speaking at SXSW in 2017. ""We are going through the process where software will automate software, automation will automate automation.""

119,Cramer says owning too many stocks and too little cash can set you up for failure,"Every morning at his old hedge fund, CNBC's Jim Cramer would spend a few hours going over the mistakes he made the day before.
""I would analyze every losing trade — you don't need to analyze the winners, they take care of themselves — [and] I'd try to figure out how I could've made more money or, much more importantly, lost less money,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said.
After a few years of this routine, something finally dawned on him.
""I realized that good performance could be linked directly to having fewer positions,"" Cramer said. ""When we owned fewer stocks, we tended to make more money.""
Ever since, Cramer hasn't bought a stock without taking a different one off the table, even for his ActionAlertsPlus.com charitable trust.
Limiting your holdings can be a great tool for investors that don't have the time or the drive to do their homework for 20 or 30 different companies, Cramer said.
That said, not owning too many stocks comes with a price, too.
""It can be constraining,"" Cramer acknowledged. ""You'll end up selling some stocks that are good for stocks that aren't as good. I know that. Hindsight's 20-20. But take it from me: as someone who's owned stocks for 40 years, it's far more likely that you'll be selling marginal companies in order to get bigger in better ones.""
Cramer's rule of thumb is that if you're an individual investor and own more than 10 stocks, you might want to consider paring back.
What should you do with the leftover money? Heed another key Cramerism and keep some cash on hand.
""Cash is for winners,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You don't like the market? You don't like any sectors? Then sell stock, raise cash.""
After decades in the business, Cramer has found that putting cash to work when the market's low is often a much better strategy than buying put options or shorting stocks.
Investors don't need to bend themselves backwards to hedge against risk. Sometimes, it can be as simple as selling some stocks and getting some cash on hand.
""Go sit on the sidelines – nothing wrong with that – [and] wait for the situation to improve. Believe me, it's never the wrong call when you don't like the tape or you can't find anything that truly makes sense for you,"" Cramer concluded. ""The bottom line? Always be careful not to own too many stocks, and not to have too little cash.""

(Corrects headline following release of USDA data; no changes to text) CHICAGO, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures closed higher on Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Agriculture trimmed its forecast of U.S. 2017-18 soybean ending stocks in a monthly report, bucking trade expectations for an increase. Wheat closed modestly higher on technical buying and worries about poor weather in the U.S. Plains wheat belt, while corn drifted lower. Chicago Board of Trade May soybean futures settled up 3 cents at $10.50 a bushel after reaching $10.64, the contract's highest in a month. CBOT May wheat ended up 1-1/4 cents at $4.92 a bushel while May corn closed down 1-1/2 cents at $3.89-1/4 a bushel. Soybeans climbed to session highs after the USDA trimmed its 2017-18 U.S. soybean ending stocks forecast to 550 million bushels, down from 555 million last month and below an average of analyst estimates for 574 million. The government raised its estimate of the U.S. 2017-18 soybean crush, implying strong processor demand for soybeans and increased production of soymeal, while leaving its U.S. soy export forecast unchanged. ""That might have been a mild surprise,"" Allendale Inc chief strategist Rich Nelson said of the unchanged soybean export forecast. ""Given the drop for Argentina's production, it's relatively reasonable. They (USDA) are going to take a wait-and-see attitude until they see if we get extra sales from the lower Argentine crop,"" Nelson said. The USDA slashed its estimate of Argentina's drought-hit soybean crop to 40 million tonnes, from 47 million in March, while raising its estimate of Brazil's soy crop to 115 million tonnes, from 113 million last month. CBOT soybeans got an early boost after the USDA through its daily reporting system said private exporters sold 120,000 tonnes of U.S. new-crop soybeans to Argentina, marking the South American country's largest purchase of U.S. soybeans in 20 years. CBOT wheat futures closed higher after a choppy session as traders returned their focus to poor weather in the southern U.S. Plains winter wheat belt. The USDA late on Monday rated 30 percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop in good to excellent condition, down from 32 percent a week earlier and 53 percent a year ago. However, some traders said the firm close in CBOT wheat was mostly technical, noting that K.C. hard red winter wheat futures ended lower.

Tesla's move to shut down production of its Model 3 for six days is a ""big deal"" but it's not necessarily a bad thing, tech analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster told CNBC on Tuesday.
The electric automaker plans to pause production at its California factory at the end of Ma y to work on fixes to its assembly line, sources inside the company told Reuters.
""This manufacturing shutdown is evidence that things are moving in a good direction,"" Munster said on "" Closing Bell. "" VCG/VCG | Getty Images A Tesla Model 3 car is on display during the Auto China 2018 at China International Exhibition Center on April 25, 2018 in Beijing, China.
Tesla had previously warned of 10 days of temporary shutdowns this quarter to address issues that have delayed volume production of its new Model 3 sedan.
Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, explained that Tesla's desire to re-engineer the manufacturing process requires the shutdown. However, he said he is ""delighted"" about the new technology it plans to implement, which he called ""a whole new paradigm around manufacturing.""
Meanwhile, Munster is also not concerned about the recent management shakeup at Tesla. Tech

OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia warned oil traders on Friday that a dramatic upswing in crude futures was little reason to become complacent. 
Speaking to reporters in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the kingdom's Energy Minister, Khalid al-Falih, told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick : ""We have to be patient. We shouldn't jump the gun, we shouldn't be complacent and listen to some of the noise such as 'mission accomplished'. I think we still have work ahead of us."" 
OPEC, Russia and several other allied producers have spearheaded an ongoing effort to try to clear a global supply overhang and prop up prices. The agreement, which came into effect in January 2017, has already been extended through until the end of this year — with producers scheduled to meet in June to review policy. 
The initial target of the supply-cutting deal was to reduce industrialized nations' oil inventories back to their five-year average. Nonetheless, with several major global producers honing in on achieving their original aim, there is little indication from the world's top exporter that it wishes to wind down the supply cuts. 
OPEC and its partners meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Friday, with the 14-member oil cartel then set to reconvene on June 22 to review to its oil production policy. Sam Meredith Digital Reporter, CNBC.com Playing",2018-04-20T10:42:00.000+03:00
4364,A cryptocurrency exchange lost $3 million — and thinks its security chief stole it,"Indian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsecure has lost over $3.5 million and is blaming its head of security.
In a message posted to its website Thursday, the company said that its Chief Security Officer (CSO) Amitabh Saxena was extracting a cryptocurrency known as bitcoin gold in order to distribute it to customers. But Coinsecure claimed the funds were lost in the process.
Director Mohit Kalra has sent a letter to Indian authorities about the incident. In the document posted on the company's website, Kalra said that 438.318 bitcoin have gone missing. This equates to just over $3.5 million at Friday's bitcoin price.
Users' funds were kept in a secure bitcoin wallet and the private keys were kept by Saxena and Kalra. Private keys are essentially required to send cryptocurrency out of a storage wallet. Having the private key allows you to move money.
""As the private keys are kept with Dr Amitabh Saxena, we feel that he is making a false story to divert our attention and he might have a role to play in this entire incident,"" the letter written by Kalra said.
""The incident reported by Dr Amitabh Saxena does not seem convincing to us. Dr Amitabh Saxena also has an Indian passport and he might fly out of the country soon. Therefore, his passport should be seized so he cannot fly out of the country.""
CNBC has emailed the Cyber Crime Cell department of the Delhi police department, where the letter was allegedly sent to, in order to confirm if it is real. There has been no response as of yet.
Coinsecure said it is trying to recover the lost funds, but it will reimburse customers from the company's personal funds. CNBC has reached out to the company to ask when this process might begin and has yet to receive a response. CNBC also asked if the company has had contact with Saxena, but a spokesperson pointed to the statement on Coinsecure's website.
The loss of funds marks one of the first major issues on an Indian cryptocurrency exchange.
Delhi's police department warns against people getting involved in cryptocurrencies because of the ""absence of legal framework,"" according to its website.
""These currencies are normally used by criminals operating on the dark web or the hidden web. Legal, bonafide businesses do not normally use bitcoins. Therefore any request for business transaction in bitcoins should raise suspicious and should be avoided,"" the police department said.
India's central bank recently banned regulated financial institutions in the country from dealing with cryptocurrencies.
Coinsecure is not the only exchange in the world to suffer problems like this. The most recent high-profile case happened in Japan, where Coincheck had over $500 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen .",2018-04-13T14:38:00.000+03:00
6799,Long distance donors shaping House primary races as Tuesday voting nears,"As the battle heats up for control of Congress, primary contests across the nation are drawing large pools of money from long distance donors who are shaping the outcome of key races.
Nearly 2,700 candidates are vying for one of the 435 U.S. House seats up for grabs in November. So far, they've raised more than $800 million for their campaigns, according to the latest data from the Federal Elections Commission. Though it's still early in this year's midterm cycle, roughly two thirds of that money has come from outside those candidates districts.
Of the 41 seats in the four states holding primaries Tuesday, candidates in more than half those districts have collectively raised more than a million dollars.
The midterm cycle enters a critical stage in the coming weeks as primaries in dozens of states begin to winnow down a pack of thousands of congressional hopefuls to a relative handful of contenders.
The first of a series of multi-state primaries is set for Tuesday, when candidates face off in Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and North Carolina. Most congressional districts in those states largely favor Republicans in the November elections.
More than 60 people have signed up to run for North Carolina's 13 congressional seats, where Republicans currently hold 10.
Most of Ohio's 16 districts are also considered ""safe"" for the incumbent party, four of which are held by Democrats. The wild card race could come out of a special election set for August in Ohio's Twelfth, which is currently vacant.
Indiana's House delegation consists of seven Republicans and two Democrats; all of those seats are considered ""safe."" So are West Virginia's three GOP seats.
Most of the districts are considered ""safe"" for incumbent party. But there are a number of hard fought races to determine who will get their party's nomination to run for those seats. Here are five races to watch:
Ohio 15th In Ohio's 15th congressional district, GOP incumbent Steve Stivers has one of the biggest campaign war chests among this cycle's House candidates, with nearly $2.8 million in direct contributions as of the end of the first quarter. Stivers has raised much of that from long distance donors; of the money raised among individual contributors, nearly 80 percent came from outside the district, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Stivers, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, has raised nearly two-thirds of his campaign cash from political action committees. More than half a million in donations have come from PACs representing the insurance, securities, real estate and banking industries, according to CRP.
Two Democrats, Rob Jarvis, a high school government teacher, and Rick Neal, a former humanitarian aid worker and stay-at-home Dad, are facing off to challenge Stivers. Neither Democratic candidate has run for political office.
As of the end of the first quarter, Neal had raised about $400,000; no data was available for Jarvis.
North Carolina 9th North Carolina incumbent Republican Robert Pittenger won his Ninth district seat easily in 2016, but he faces both a GOP challenger, Mark Harris, and a well-funded Democrat Dan MacCready, a veteran Marine who has so far outraised both his Republican rivals.
On the right, Pittenger is fighting back a repeat challenge from Harris, who lost the 2016 GOP primary by a slim margin.
Democrats see an opportunity to flip the downstate seat, which stretches along the South Carolina border between Charlotte and Fayetteville from red to blue.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put North Carolina's 9th district on its 2018 target list. Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer has been among McCready's biggest financial backers, pledging more than $1 million to his campaign, according to Ballotpedia.
Ohio 12th Five districts in the four states holding primaries Tuesday have fielded large packs looking to fill seats left open by members who have resigned or who plan to retire. One of the most crowded races is in Ohio's twelfth district, a midstate district just north of Columbus.
The seat opened up for the first time in 18 years when incumbent Republican Patrick Tiberi resigned in January, sparking a stampede of nearly two dozen candidates, according to FEC records. The winners of Tuesday's Democrat and Republican primaries will face off in August in a special election to fill the seat until January, 2019.
But that's not the end of the story. The same two candidates will face off again in November in the general election to serve the two-year term than begins that month.
On the Republican side, the field includes state Senator Troy Balderson, businesswoman Malanie Leneghan, conservative economist Tim Kanem the top three fundraisers as of the end of the first quarter.
Franklin Country recorder Danny O'Connor, 31, has raised the most cash among the seven Democrats in the race, but he has a much smaller campaign fund than his GOP rivals.
The seat, which went for Trump in 2016, is considered safe for Republicans.
Indiana Sixth Indiana's sixth district opened up after GOP incumbent Luke Messer opted to run for U.S. Senate in November.
Democrats have not had much luck raising money for this solidly Republican district, which Trump carried by 40 points in 2016. But Republican businessman Jonathan Lamb has raised more than $800,000 – mostly from his own pocket – to challenge Greg Pence, a Columbus businessman who is running to win the seat once held by his younger brother, Vice President Mike Pence.
Greg Pence's House race has drawn the attention of national donors; about half of the million dollars he had raised as of the end of the first quarter came from outside the district.
Aside from his brother, Pence has also picked up key GOP endorsements form House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
West Virginia Third It's unlikely this solidly Republican seat will flip parties, but it's less clear which the GOP candidates in the race will appear on the ballot in November.
The seat opened up last year when incumbent Evan Jenkins decided to run for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin. Since then, the race has drawn several Republicans who have aligned themselves with policies pursued by President Trump, who won the district in 2016 by nearly 50 points.
As of the end of the first quarter, Carol Miller, a member of the state House of Delegates, had raised roughly as much as her next two best-funded GOP rivals, state Delegate Rupert Phillips Jr., and Conrad Lucas, a former state party chairman.",2018-05-06T17:00:00.000+03:00

991,"LeBron James, maybe the cheapest player in the NBA, has one big money regret","Though he's one of the highest paid athletes today with $86 million in earnings, LeBron James is surprisingly frugal. In fact, the Cleveland Cavalier says he's the cheapest player in the NBA . ""I'm not turning on data roaming. I'm not buying no apps. I still got Pandora with commercials,"" James said in an interview with ESPN.
His rep is so good that teammate Iman Shumpert would trust James to handle his investments : ""If I ever wanted to have someone on the team invest my money, it'd be LeBron,"" Shumpert told Wealthsimple .
But even King James has slipped up.
On a new episode of "" Kneading Dough ,"" host Maverick Carter asked James if there's any purchase he regrets making. The NBA star was quick to respond: ""Yeah, I bought a house in Las Vegas.""
Kirk Irwin | Getty Images LeBron James It was in 2005, when James was in his early 20s and his salary with the Cavs was $4.6 million .
He explained his thought process to Carter: ""Every summer — obviously our training camp was in Vegas — I would go to Vegas. I'm young. ... I'm 21, 22. My family's coming out. They love it. Let's buy a house!""
""You idiot,"" James said of his younger self. ""Who buys a house in Vegas?""
He's not the only star athlete with big money regrets. Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors spent $21,000 in one night at a club. ""That's $21,000 that I can never get back,"" he told Carter in a separate episode of ""Kneading Dough.

James has also come a long way since his most regrettable purchase. In addition to co-founding the media platform Uninterrupted , which raised $15.8 million in 2015 , he was an early backer of Beats Headphones. When the company sold to Apple for $3 billion, James reportedly earned $30 million . His "" next thing "" is to own an NBA team.
James is already thinking about life after basketball because ""I know there will be more time of my life spent off the floor than on the floor,"" he told Carter. ""I still have to live life beyond the hardwood.""

Cold weather may be unbearable for some people, but it usually means more money for investors in Netflix and North Face maker VF Corp. 
CNBC analysis using Kensho found that Netflix and VF Corp . shares have averaged a gain of 35 percent and 7 percent, respectively, between Nov. 30 and March 31 over the past 10 years. The analysis also found that both stocks have traded positive 80 percent and 100 percent, respectively, in that time period. 
Other stocks that have kept investors warm during the cold winter include Home Depot, Domino's Pizza and Autozone . Both Home Depot and Autozone have averaged a return of 11 percent during the last 10 winters, while Domino's has averaged a 24 percent gain. 
The East Coast of the U.S. is experiencing frigid conditions and temperatures are expected to drop further throughout the week. 
The National Weather Service issued winter storm watches and warnings on Wednesday from north central Florida through Eastern New England. The service also said an area of low pressure will move up the Atlantic Coast Thursday and Friday. Here's what to buy if it gets really cold 
CNBC found that some travel and retail stocks tend to outperform the market when the U.S. is hit by cold wave, which is a rapid fall in temperature during a 24-hour period. 
Priceline shares have gained an average of 9.1 percent one month after an official cold wave (as determined by the National Weather Service) strikes since 1997, while Royal Caribbean climb an 7.9 percent. The cold weather likely gets people to travel to warmer locales or at least start planning to do so. 
Other stocks that perform well following such weather events are Target and Macy's. Target's average return after a cold wave is 6.6 percent, while Macy's averages a return of 6.3 percent. Warm winters could hurt department stores by leaving a lot of cold weather clothes inventory on the books. The S&P 500 meanwhile, has averaged a return of 2.2 percent in these instances dating back to 1997. 
Natural gas stocks, meanwhile, have lagged the market after a cold wave hits the U.S. 
Shares of Concho Resources has averaged a decline of 15.2 percent after the last five cold waves dating back to 1997. Newfield Exploration, Chesapeake Energy, and Transocean have also averaged declines of more than 10 percent. Anadarko Petroleum shares, meanwhile, have fallen an average of 9 percent, according to Kensho.

4869,"UPDATE 3-EU bans 20 Brazilian meat plants, hits 35 pct of exports","UPDATE 3-EU bans 20 Brazilian meat plants, hits 35 pct of exports Ana Mano and Samantha Koester Published 5:27 PM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 Reuters 
(Recasts with impact of ban, adds Brazil's agriculture minister quotes) 
BRUSSELS/SAO PAULO, April 19 (Reuters) - Europe's decision to ban meat imports from several Brazilian suppliers affects 30 to 35 percent of the country's exports to the bloc and will force companies to find new markets while officials work to reverse the measure, Brazil's Agriculture Minister said. 
The European Union on Thursday suspended imports of Brazilian meat products, mostly poultry, in a move that affected 20 plants in the South American nation that had been authorized to export to the EU, according to a European Commission statement. 
""I was in Europe last week and we were waiting for a definition of how many, if any plants, were going to be de-listed,"" Minister Blairo Maggi told reporters in Paraná after the measure was unveiled. 
""We need to start talks to reestablish these plants as soon as possible,"" he said. 
Maggi noted the Brazilian government would request that a trade mission be allowed in Europe to negotiate a reversal of the measure. Meanwhile, he said, Brazilian companies ""will have to search for new markets to quickly substitute these exports."" 
The ban also dealt a blow to Brazil's largest chicken processor, BRF SA, which had 12 plants delisted by the EU after its involvement in a food safety investigation. 
Twenty plants were affected by the EU's decision, eight of which were operated by smaller companies, according to a draft document related to the decision seen by Reuters on Thursday. 
JBS SA, Brazil's second-largest chicken meat producer, had no plants affected by the ban, a source close to the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
BRF did not have an immediate comment on the ban. JBS declined to comment. 
BRF stock, which rose 10 percent in early trading, pared gains to close 4.9 percent higher despite the setback. BRF shares soared after top shareholders on Wednesday agreed to appoint a new board chairman who investors felt could pull off a successful turnaround. 
Earlier in the week the Brazilian government threatened to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discuss its claims that the EU chicken import quotas breached global trade rules. 
The government affirmed its intention after the EU decision on Thursday, claiming European trade restrictions were ""not a health issue."" 
Brazil's basic argument is that, when domestic companies that export chicken have to pay a 1,024 euro tariff per tonne, health demands are relaxed. ""This will be what we will complain about at the WTO,"" Maggi said. 
The EC said the ban was related to ""deficiencies detected in the Brazilian official control system."" The ban will apply 15 days after the publication in the official journal of the European Union, it added.

5315,4 things to do before opening a credit card,"10:33 AM ET Wed, 21 March 2018 | 01:22 
About 49 million Americans have never changed their main credit card , according to a recent survey from CreditCards.com. Nearly 20 million people haven't switched cards in 10 years. 
While sticking with your favorite card can reflect positively on your credit score , switching cards or opening a new one, in some cases, can have certain perks , too. For example, you could rack up travel rewards miles or pay a lower interest rate . 
If you're in the market for a new card, here are a few helpful tips: Do your research 
Before applying for a new card, it pays to do a little background reading, says financial website Bankrate . 
""If you want a cash-back card for everyday purchases like groceries and gas, do the places you frequent accept the card?"" Or, ""if the card is for travel,"" says Bankrate, ""is it commonly accepted in the places you visit or by the airlines you fly?"" 
When you identify how you want to use the card, look for low interest rates. Rates currently range from the low teens to the mid-20s, Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com senior industry analyst, says . You can get a lower annual percentage rate, though, if you have excellent credit . show chapters 11:49 AM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 | 00:52 Look for perks 
Update yourself with the latest credit-card offers, as card issuers often offer sign-up bonuses to new customers. Those bonuses could come in the form of additional credit points, cash back or other rewards, like a free night at a hotel or travel miles. 
Grace Cheng and Pedro Pla, the founders of credit-card advice site GET.com , took advantage of those rewards to get an epic trip. Through savvy planning, they accumulated enough credit-card points to save $54,000 on airline tickets, which they used to fly to five continents. 
""The time spent planning, comparing cards and working toward the goal"" of earning 1 million travel miles ""was more than worth it,"" they say. However, they add, beware: ""Most card bonuses come with a minimum spend requirement within a certain time period."" 
Some cards, for example, require you spend a certain amount to get that reward, such as $3,000 or $4,000 within a few months. And ""the last thing people should do is overspend to get rewards,"" according to Schulz. ""That's just asking for trouble."" Be careful closing old accounts 
Your old credit card accounts can help boost your financial record, CreditCards.com explains . So getting a new card doesn't necessarily mean you should close out your other accounts. 
""Your credit score is based, in part, on your utilization rate,"" which is the ratio of how much you've spent on your credit card versus the limit on that card. ""Canceling old accounts reduces the total amount of your available credit, changing that ratio."" Any balance will utilize a higher percentage of your credit, which could end up hurting your score. 
There is an exception to closing accounts, though, Schultz says: If your old card has an annual fee and you're certain you're not going to use it anymore, you may consider shutting it down. show chapters 7:56 AM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 | 01:10 Consider your timing 
Be aware of your timing on getting a new card. If you plan to make a big purchase like a home or car within a year, you may want to hold off on opening a new card. 
""When you ask for a new account or an increase in your credit line, the issuer does a hard inquiry into your credit history and that can lower your credit score,"" according to Bankrate. If you have good credit and a lengthy history, though, the inquiry will have less of an impact. ",2018-04-05T18:18:00.000+03:00
5222,"Trump campaign paid lawyer $93,000 to warn Steve Bannon, Michael Wolff over ‘Fire and Fury’","President Donald Trump 's re-election campaign paid $93,000 to a law firm earlier this year to fight back against Michael Wolff's hotly debated White House tell-all book, ""Fire and Fury.""
Harder LLP — founded by Charles Harder, who represented pro wrestler Hulk Hogan in his case against Gawker — received two payments for its efforts on Trump's behalf. One payment of $25,000 was made in January and another for just over $68,000 was made in February, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings from the Trump campaign, released Sunday.
The payments to Harder's firm were largely in compensation for taking on former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon , who was a major source for the book, and Wolff, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Harder was hired to send cease-and-desist letters in early January to Bannon as well as to the book's publisher, Henry Holt and Co., just as the book started to make headlines ahead of its Jan. 5 publication.
show chapters Trump hosts tax reform roundtable in Florida 21 Hours Ago | 01:28 In the letter to Bannon, Harder claimed the former Trump advisor broke the nondisclosure agreement he signed when he left the White House. Harder also demanded Bannon save all communications he ever had with Wolff.
Just days before the book's publication, Harder's firm called on Henry Holt and Co. to halt publication and issue a ""full and complete retraction and apology"" to Trump. Instead, the company published the book a few days earlier than the originally planned publication date.
According to Wolff, Bannon used the word ""treasonous"" to describe a meeting the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had with a Kremlin-backed lawyer at Trump Tower in 2016. Bannon also personally insulted the president's son-in-law and senior aide, Jared Kushner, the book says.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not return requests for comment about the payments to Harder. Harder did not return repeated emails for comment. Bannon and Henry Holt and Co. also did not return requests for comment.
Small donors and big legal fees But the mere fact that Harder's legal fees were paid by Trump's presidential campaign, and not by Trump himself, signals that the Trump campaign is open to spending donors' money to fight what some might see as the president's own personal legal battles.
Trump is not up for re-election until November 2020, at which point nearly three years will have elapsed since ""Fire and Fury"" was published. Still, Trump's campaign appears poised to spend, and to raise, money as if the election were around the corner.
Sunday's filing also revealed that the Trump campaign raised $10 million during the first quarter of the year and spent about $3.9 million. Approximately 20 percent of that amount was spent on legal expenses — including the $93,000 to Harder's law firm. In total, the Trump re-election campaign reported paying eight separate law firms for work between January and March of this year.
Harder's firm — along with law firm Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha — has been part of Trump's legal battle with Daniels, but sources close to the campaign say the payments made during the first quarter were not connected to that fight. The Trump campaign paid $186,000 to Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha in the first three months of the year.
The campaign also shelled out $376,000 to the firm Jones Day, which is representing the campaign on election law and campaign finance compliance, as well as matters related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
The latest legal expense reports come as one of the president's other lawyers, Michael Cohen, is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after he paid a $130,000 settlement to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.
Following Sunday's filing, the Trump campaign touted the high percentage of small-dollar donors who contributed during the first part of the year.
""With 97.7 percent of our contributions from small donors, patriotic Americans throughout America are signaling their emphatic approval of Donald Trump's performance as President and his commitment to continue to Make America Great Again despite the obstruction of the President's many opponents,"" Michael Glassner, chief operating officer for the Trump campaign, said in a press release.

4,"If you want to beat S&P 500 in 2018, these 4 international ETFs may do it","Home stock market bias remains strong in the United States, but more investors opened portfolios to international equities last year. Roughly $150 billion went into international exchange-traded funds in 2017, compared to just $16 billion the year before. Investors who diversified overseas were rewarded with performance in both developed markets ex-U.S. and emerging markets that rivaled returns from the Dow and S&P 500. The MSCI All Country World Index finished last year up about 21.5 percent, outperforming the S&P 500's 19 percent return, according to S&P Capital IQ data.
With the backdrop for global growth continuing to be positive — with relatively low interest rates and strong consumer confidence — the case for global equities remains strong, in particular for investors yet to make the move at all. So far, the All Country World Index has outperformed the S&P 500 in January by more than one percentage point and, if the experts are right — Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan research predicts greater gains for emerging markets than the S&P 500 in 2018 — global stocks could again beat the U.S. market. Even if the performance doesn't match last year's torrid pace, international stock diversification helps .
One of the easiest ways to own global stocks is through ETFs, which are inexpensive, broadly diversified and easy to buy and sell.
""Rather than finding the best ideas yourself or paying a premium to someone else to potentially find the best stocks, you can use an ETF to cover the globe extremely inexpensively,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research.
They are also more tax efficient than mutual funds because turnover is low, creating fewer taxable events, like the triggering of capital gains.
show chapters Global growth pushes emerging markets to best year since 2009 2:51 PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 01:22 But which ones should you buy? There are so many ETFs to choose from, and just because a hot sector or country ETF did well — such as the WisdomTree China ex-State Owned Enterprises fund ( CXSE ) and the Kranshares CSI China Internet ETF ( KWEB ), up 79 percent and 67 percent, respectively, in 2017 — doesn't mean they will do it again.
Instead, investors should buy funds that will do well over the long term, Rosenbluth said. They should have relatively low expense ratios and provide diversified exposure to markets that would be difficult for investors to navigate on their own.
For investors looking to add global exposure to their portfolios in 2018 — and still strong returns at a low cost — then consider starting with these four funds, recommended by experts at Morningstar and CFRA Research.
Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) Investors looking for broad-based international exposure should consider this Vanguard favorite, said Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of passive strategies. It has $321 billion in assets under management and holds stocks of all sizes in about 48 countries.
While Japan and the U.K. are the two largest country holdings in VXUS — at 17.7 percent and 12.3 percent of its assets, respectively — the rest of its assets are fairly spread out around the world. ""It blankets the whole market outside of the U.S.,"" said Bryan.
Investors will know many of its top 10 holdings, including Tencent , Nestlé , Royal Dutch Shell , Samsung and HSBC . But with 6,267 holdings, there will be a fair number of unfamiliar stocks, too. ""It's widely diversified,"" Bryan said.
He's a fan of its 0.11 percent expense ratio. ""The best reason to own this is for its low cost,"" Bryan said, adding that its fee is lower than some of its peers in the foreign large blend category.
Its 25 percent return in 2017, according to S&P Capital IQ, wasn't too shabby,either. If the global economy continues to do well then this ETF, which is already up 5.2 percent in 2018, could see even better returns in 2018, according to Bryan.
iShares EDGE MSCI Multifactor Intl ETF (INTF) This ETF only came to market two years ago, but with $503 million in assets, it has quickly become a go-to fund for savvier international investors.
It's different than the typical global ETF in that it's a smart-beta option , which means it targets stocks with specific characteristics. In this case, that's developed nation companies in the mid-cap and large-cap markets with relatively low valuations (AXA, with a $65 billion market cap, is its largest holding) and strong price momentum. The stocks are also selected based on the quality of being fiscally disciplined companies with a record of rewarding shareholders through dividends. Or to put it in technical terms, quality is based on return on equity (higher is better), debt/equity (lower is better) and earnings growth variability (lower is better). ""This combination of characteristics has historically experienced higher returns over time,"" Bryan said.
The Morningstar ETF expert likes this fund because each characteristic works well at different times, which adds another layer of diversification and reduces the risk of longer periods of underperformance. INTF owns stocks in more than 13 countries, including Japan, the U.K, France, Australia and Canada. Top holdings include Hitachi , AXA and Michelin .

It helps that the ETF has performed well against comparable non-smart-beta peers — in 2017 it returned nearly 24 percent, while the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF ( EFA ) climbed by 21 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ. Its expense ratio of 0.30 percent is competitive with more traditional international funds. But the decision shouldn't come down to fund fee alone.
""This is for someone who's looking to beat the market and who would choose a more complex strategy and can understand what they're getting,"" Bryan said.
iShares Core Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) This emerging market fund, which has nearly $46 billion, is ideal for anyone who wants exposure to fast-growing parts of the world but don't want to take on specific country risk. With a 0.14 percent expense ratio, it's cheap, but it's also a strong performer, posting a 34 percent return in 2017.
Rosenbluth likes this ETF because of what's in it ­­­— ""a lot of great non-U.S. companies,"" he said. Its biggest holding, accounting for 4.91 percent, is Tencent Holdings , a high-flying Chinese internet company that's up 122 percent over the past 12 months. It also holds Samsung Electronics , Alibaba Group , Taiwan Semiconductor and several other quickly growing firms.
While this is more diversified than owning a country fund, it does have 28 percent of its assets in China and another 15 percent in South Korea, so you are taking on some more localized risk with this ETF, but that's also why it's doing so well.
""It's outperforming because it has exposure to South Korea, which is outperforming the broader emerging market index,"" said Rosenbluth. ""If you want broad emerging market exposure in a low-cost manner, this is a great product to consider.""

3051,Inflation data is the wild card for markets Tuesday,"Chances are the consumer price index will be a sleeper for markets Tuesday, but if it's not, watch for interest rates to spike and stocks to sell off.
The CPI is expected to come in at 0.2 percent both for headline inflation and core, which excludes energy and food, according to Thomson Reuters. That compares with last month's report of higher-than-expected 0.5 percent gain in headline inflation in January and an increase of 0.349 percent on core, the most on a monthly basis since 2005.
""We're expecting it to be lower than last month. I don't think people are expecting much volatility around it, but you never know,"" said Justin Lederer, fixed income strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""It's a key component for the Fed.""
The Fed meets next week, and it's expected to raise interest rates by a quarter regardless of what the latest consumer inflation data says. But markets are on the watch for anything hotter than expected. Rising inflation could get the Fed changing its forecast and moving faster than expected to increase its fed funds target range.
""I think the market hinges on the CPI now more than it does on payroll numbers. You think about what the Fed has in its calculus with the dual mandate. No matter how many good employment reports you get, you know the same thing, you're at or near full employment,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies.
""Inflation is a different animal,"" he said. ""There's a lot of different opinions on what the recent data means. It's either that we're on the path toward a certain target or we're not.""
The February employment report on Friday sent stocks rocketing, with 313,000 non-farm payrolls but a muted wage gain and a downward revision to January's wages. 
But the CPI is not expected to be too dramatic, and the core, expected at 1.8 percent, is still below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target. Headline inflation is expected to be up 2.2 percent, up from 2.1 percent last month, according to Thomson Reuters.
Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Capital Markets, said core CPI should reach the Fed's 2 percent target in the April report, and last year's weak data will make for easy comparisons for a number of months.
""We saw a month-to-month decline in the core. That won't fall out of the calculation until you get the March data this year, and you'll rise from 1.8 to 2.1. ... We have core CPI creeping a little higher throughout the year,"" he said. He said CPI should reach the Fed's 2 percent target by April and then move sideways for the rest of the year.
Energy bumped up January's headline CPI, and it should be more muted in February's number. Cummins expects the 0.2 percent rise expected by the consensus.
As for the Fed, the CPI won't make much difference for next week's meeting. If it should be way off the mark, it could impact its longer-term thinking.
""I don't think it's necessarily going to be a game changer. I don't think it necessarily changes the outcome,"" he said. ""Of course, if you did see a 0.3 or 0.4 on the core, you would probably start to add to the evidence that you're starting to see a little more inflation than we thought.""

3124,Elon Musk’s brother Kimbal: This was the 'best decision of my life',"After working with older brother Elon Musk to launch tech companies Zip2 and PayPal in the 1990s, entrepreneur Kimbal Musk pivoted to an industry that would change his life: the food industry.
Today, Musk's goal is to revolutionize access to local, healthy and unprocessed food through efforts like his casual dining start-up The Kitchen and food education nonprofit organization Big Green . In a Reddit "" Ask Me Anything"" session on Tuesday, he brought attention to Big Green's school wellness programs and a new campaign raising money for seeds, plants and supplies for school gardens.
On Reddit, he revealed that getting involved with farming and waging war on America's food system turned out to be the perfect move. ""Food is my love and when I decided to tie my passion with my purpose, my only choice was food,"" Musk said. ""Best decision of my life.""
The Kitchen, along with his other restaurants Next Door and Hedge Row, is part of Musk's mission to help improve access to fresh food across America. Earlier this year, the community-oriented, non-profit part of The Kitchen spun out into Big Green, which implements food literacy programs and provides educational outdoor gardens for school across the U.S.
While Big Green has created 378 school gardens since 2011, Musk's fundraising aims to help another 1,000 school gardens open across the U.S. by the end of 2020. Big Green's ultimate goal is to expose children to healthier habits and cut rates of chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity by providing hands-on experiences of growing fruits and vegetables.
There's a notable tie-in to his older brother's company with his fundraising campaign: In exchange for donations as little as $25, Musk is raffling off a chance to win his own fully customized Tesla —which happens to be the sixth one ever made — through the end of April.
Kimbal Musk Tweet
During the AMA, he also took the opportunity to discuss his experiences as an entrepreneur. Like many others, Musk said he is constantly learning about how best to run his business.
""My first really hard mistake was over-charging for my work when I was younger. It told me incorrectly that people did not want my product, but the truth was that I was being arrogant and pricing it out of the market,"" Musk said.
""I almost shut the business down. Ever since then I have been intensely focused on under-pricing until I really know the market,"" he added.
When it comes to handling criticism on his own entrepreneurial projects, Musk said he is his own worst enemy. ""Self-doubt [is] the sh-ttiest part of being an entrepreneur. Doubt from others is usually much easier to handle,"" he said.
Kimbal Tesla 3 Tweet
Musk also shared advice for other entrepreneurs. ""It's a great time to be an entrepreneur,"" he said. ""[My] best advice is to just get started. Once you've started, stay true to your passion and persist through the hard times.""
He added, ""Building businesses is a brutal process at times but it is so rewarding building something the world values.""
For those who are in their early stages of building their company and product, Musk said it's okay to ""fail early and often.""
""Obsess about your product. Get it out into consumers hands as fast as possible,"" Musk added. ""Refine the product until it resonates.""
Even still, as a pioneer of the farm-to-table movement in the U.S., Musk is adamant about following through with his passion for changing the way Americans of all ages eat.
""I strongly believe that success in my mission is what matters,"" Musk said. ""Many people focus on success and happiness of themselves and I have learned that for me, a focus on the mission is what makes me happy.""

6407,"UPDATE 3-U.S. cuts off Brazil tariff talks, adopts steel import quotas","UPDATE 3-U.S. cuts off Brazil tariff talks, adopts steel import quotas Bruno Federowski and Alberto Alerigi Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters
(Adds White House comment)
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, May 2 (Reuters) - Brazil on Wednesday contradicted a United States announcement that the two countries had reached a deal on a permanent exemption from steel and aluminum import tariffs, saying the Trump administration had unilaterally cut off talks.
Representatives for Brazil's industry decried U.S. negotiation tactics, which the head of the association for aluminum producers, Milton Rego, called ""Al Capone-like.""
""You get better results by pointing a gun to the head,"" he said.
Under a new quota-based system, exports of Brazilian steel to the United States fall by around a fifth, dealing a blow to a key sector already grappling with widespread idle capacity and excessive global supply.
The White House said on Monday that it had reached agreements for permanent exemptions on steel and aluminum for Brazil, Argentina and Australia, and that the details of the deals would be finalized shortly. It gave no details of the terms.
Brazil's foreign and trade ministries said on Wednesday the U.S. government had called off talks on April 26 after giving Brazil the option of picking between tariffs or quotas.
Brazil's aluminum industry opted for 10 percent import tariffs, while the steel industry opted for an imports quota system, the statement said.
The White House said on Wednesday that details about the agreement had not been finalized and said President Trump would consider re-imposing the tariffs if they were not settled shortly.
""The United States and Brazil reached an agreement in principle on satisfactory alternative means to address the threatened impairment to our national security from steel and aluminum imports,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
""The details of this agreement in principle have not been finalized. Further, if the alternative means are not finalized shortly, the president will consider re-imposing the tariffs,"" she said.
Annual exports of Brazilian semi-finished steel products to the United States, which account for 80 percent of total exports, will be capped at 3.5 million tonnes, equivalent to the average of 2015-2017 exports and a 7 percent decline from 2017.
In a conference call with journalists, the head of Brazil's steelmakers association, Marco Polo Lopes, called those terms ""not that bad.""
But finished steel exports, which compete directly with U.S. producers, will be capped at 496,000 tonnes, or 70 percent of that average, driving an annual reduction ranging between 20 and 60 percent depending on the product.
Brazil still expects the United States to exempt it from trade restrictions, the government statement said, but ""remains willing to adopt, in bilateral and multilateral venues, all actions needed to preserve its rights and interests.""

5173,Bipartisan group in Congress joins fight to repeal tax on college endowments,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working to build support for repealing a new excise tax on potentially billions of dollars in private college endowments – just as some of the most prestigious schools in the country ratchet up their battle against the tax.
Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., and Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., sent a letter to colleagues this week seeking co-sponsors for a bill they introduced last month to eliminate the new fee. So far, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Tenn., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., have signed on.
""Once a tax gets put in place … the tax can easily be raised,"" Delaney told CNBC. ""I think every academic institution should be offended by this.""
The effort comes as Ivy League universities, which will bear the brunt of the tax, ramp up their lobbying efforts, with Harvard President Drew Faust meeting with Byrne and Delaney in Washington this week. The university boasts a $37.1 billion endowment, the largest in the country.
""Endowments are a crucial way in which colleges and universities fund financial aid that expands affordability and access, groundbreaking research that leads to cures and scientific discovery, and campus development projects that create jobs and economic growth locally,"" Faust said in a statement to CNBC. ""They are not a rainy-day fund set aside for the future.""
Uncertain numbers Under the sweeping overhaul of the tax code that Republicans passed last year, private colleges must pay a 1.4 percent annual excise tax on the gains in their endowments. The provision only applies to institutions with endowments larger than $500,000 per full-time student.
About 30 schools are likely to be affected, according to a list compiled by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. It includes some of the most prestigious schools in the country: Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, Stanford and MIT, among others.
According to government estimates, the provision will raise nearly $2 billion over the next decade, helping to offset the $1.5 trillion price tag of the new tax law. Harvard projected it would have paid $43 million on its endowment gains if the levy had been in place last fiscal year. MIT predicted the tax will cost it at least $10 million next year.
But those numbers are highly uncertain, said Karin Johns, tax policy director at the NAICU. Endowment funds used for educational purposes are exempt from the tax, but lawmakers did not define what that means.
At Harvard, for example, endowment funds cover about 36 percent of the university's operating budget – a larger share than tuition. The endowment also pays for financial aid for lower-income students, Faust said, and it is unclear whether that money would be subject to the new levy.
Without guidance from the Treasury Department and the IRS , the precise financial toll on universities remains uncertain. But Johns said many schools believe the tax will be ""devastating.""
""They just feel like they're going to have their hands tied on what they can spend their own money on on their own campuses,"" she said.
Targeted by Trump But the massive size of colleges' private endowments have come under fire from President Donald Trump , who criticized how schools spend their money while he was on the campaign trail. He promised to crack down on ""special tax breaks"" as a way to reduce the cost of higher education.
""These huge multibillion-dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt,"" Trump said during a rally in Pennsylvania in September 2016. ""Instead, they use the money to pay administrators or put donors' names on buildings.""
Delaney said the new tax is being used as a political weapon – a stick in the eye of institutions that some Republicans view as breeding grounds for liberal world views.
""They may not like what they have to say, but they shouldn't be using the tax code to attack the academic freedom and the free speech that these institutions should have protected and enjoy,"" Delaney said.",2018-04-19T19:55:00.000+03:00
3854,United Technologies CEO: 'We owe investors an answer' on whether we'll break up the company,"After announcing at an industry conference that he was considering breaking up his massive industrial company, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes elaborated on his thought process to CNBC.
Speaking to "" Mad Money "" host Jim Cramer on Friday after United Technologies' annual investor meeting, Hayes said that the potential split was a hot topic at the shareholder confab.
""I heard from a lot of investors today. Some of them say, 'Absolutely, you need to break the company up because elevators and air conditioners have nothing to do with jet engines,'"" Hayes told Cramer in an exclusive interview. ""Some of the other investors who have been around have, perhaps, a longer term perspective, understand the benefits and the synergies that you have from having a large company together.""
At the industry conference three weeks ago, Hayes wondered, according to a transcript, whether the company would be a ""more valuable property together"" or ""better off in three separate businesses.""
On Friday, Hayes continued to weigh the pros and cons, saying that United Technologies benefits from ""best-in-class"" expense costs thanks to the massive scale of its business.
""Obviously you lose some of that if you break it up, but it's still something we need to think through,"" he told Cramer. ""We need to go through the process and I think we owe investors an answer by the end of the year.""
As it stands, United Technologies is made up of four parts: Pratt & Whitney, its aircraft engine unit; UTC Aerospace Systems, the catch-all aerospace and defense systems supplier; UTC Climate, Controls & Security, which deals in things like fire safety and ventilation; and Otis, which makes elevators, escalators and moving walkways.
While some more adamant shareholders have been agitating for a breakup, Hayes said that he has made his top priority clear to United Technologies' board of directors.
""I said the first thing we need to do is close on Rockwell Collins,"" Hayes said, referencing his company's recent acquisition of the rival manufacturer. ""We'll do that in the next two, three months here, and then once we've closed on Rockwell, once we've started the integration, I told the board we'd go through a process by the end of the year to make a decision.""
And, with board members whose careers have spanned giants like GlaxoSmithKline, DowDuPont and CBS, Hayes felt his company was in good hands.
""You've got just a great, great group of people that have a keen understanding of the investors and of the business,"" the CEO said on Friday. ""And so it's not like we need to go outside and ask a lot of questions because I think the board truly understands what's important to investors and the long-term stakeholders in the business.""

4933,Death of the earnings beat: Investors don't care that companies are blowing away Wall Street's estimates,"Three out of four companies are topping Wall Street's estimates this earnings season, but investors don't seem to care this time and that's a bad sign for the market.
While share prices initially react strongly to news of a beat at the open, the stocks are being sold harshly throughout the day, according to research from Bespoke Investment Group.
Shares of companies that beat are being sold and stocks that dare miss are being punished even more harshly, according to Bespoke.
""Based on how stock prices are reacting to earnings right now, 'earnings strength' should be replaced with 'earnings stink,'"" Justin Walters, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said in an email to clients Wednesday.

The EPS beat rate stands at 76.7 percent this quarter, and the average stock that has reported first quarter numbers so far opened higher by almost half a percent afterwards, according to Walters. At one point the beat rate was as high as 80 percent, a record, according to Bespoke.
Following the ""initial pump fake higher at the open"" though, Bespoke notes, things have turned ugly.
The average stock that has reported traded 0.81 percent lower from the open to the close of trading this season. When combined with that initial rise, the average full-day change for stocks that have reported is -0.34 percent, according to the research.

Caterpillar was a prime example of that whiplash this week.
The industrial company, which is often seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, handily beat analysts' expectations in its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday. Shares opened in the green following the report, but later dropped 10 percent after bearish comments by Caterpillar management.
On the call, the company said its first-quarter profit will be ""the high-water mark for the year"" because of higher investment spending.
From a macro perspective, traders selling after the initial gap at the open is a bearish signal, Walters said.
""Given this backdrop, we would certainly avoid chasing any stocks that are initially trading higher on earnings,"" Walters said. ""The one saving grace is that it is still relatively early in the reporting period, so there's still time for the trend to turn around.""

4777,We need social workers — not Facebook — to better understand patients' health,"For a year, according to a CNBC report, Facebook developed a plan to work with hospitals to scrape an individual's social interactions from their profile to identify whether they lack social supports or have other needs when they get discharged from the hospital. 
As a doctor and health-tech investor, I'd like to propose an alternative approach: Try talking to a patient. 
Case managers and social workers already play a vitally important role, which has been historically under-appreciated and under-recognized in both the health and tech industries.
These individuals are already in regular contact with patients, usually in a clinic or hospital setting, to assess their social determinant needs (a fancy term for things like housing, transportation, financial, social support) and deploy resources to fill these gaps.
The role of technology That said, there are ways that the latest technology can help. And there's a category of emerging start-ups doing it right. 
Emerging health-tech companies like CityBlock and BehaveCare are focusing on vulnerable populations who have social determinant needs, and they understand the importance of the real humans who already work with them. Instead of scraping data, they are making the case manager and social worker more effective by deploying teams into communities and engaging patients where they reside to assess these needs and provide solutions.
Others like Nuna Health are building sophisticated data graphs that pull in information from patients' insurance claims as well as clinical data and other socio-economic information to develop a rich picture of a patient's needs.

Healthify , Aunt Bertha , and Unite Us are another group of start-ups solely focused on assessing and mapping",2018-04-10T20:22:00.000+03:00
1715,Fed's Kashkari: Biggest banks need to double current capital levels,"If Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari gets his way, the nation's biggest banks will need to keep more cash on hand — a lot more.
The central bank branch has been studying the issue of how to prevent situations like the one that led to the financial crisis in 2008, and Kashkari said it is nearly ready to release recommendations it has gleaned from multiple public symposiums.
""Basically we need to double the capital requirement of the biggest dozen banks in America,"" he said during a question-and-answer session Tuesday.
Kashkari said the Minneapolis Fed is ""about to release the final versions of our plan,"" and he acknowledged that the position he has been taking about big banks has not been popular.
""Some have expelled me,"" he said of friends in the banking industry. ""Some of my good friends are really angry that I came out and said the biggest banks are too big to fail.""
Indeed, the former Pimco executive, Treasury official and Republican California gubernatorial candidate has been railing against the financial industry's titans for years. He has charged that conditions exist that still could cause another crisis despite the myriad additional regulatory burdens put on banks in the past seven years.
For instance, he has taken on Jamie Dimon after the J.P. Morgan Chase CEO said the problem of too big to fail had been solved.
Kashkari said banks should have to follow capital rules similar to those imposed on ordinary borrowers who have to pay a 20 percent deposit when buying homes.
""If we made banks put 20 percent down in terms of equity on their own portfolio, we would basically protect taxpayers against future bailouts. Right now they have about half the equity they need,"" he said. ""We can't control everything, but if we can identify the risks, do the analysis, put forward sensible solutions, then other legislators and policymakers can take it forward.""",2018-01-09T17:50:00.000+02:00

6457,"Cramer commends Estee Lauder's CEO, advises buying beauty stock despite its poor performance","As shares of Estee Lauder Companies slid on Monday amid widespread weakness in the consumer packaged goods stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer came out in defense of the decades-old beauty giant.
""The truth is Estee Lauder's miles ahead of its peers and the stock deserves to be a lot higher,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Bizarrely, this stock's been getting slammed ... as investors didn't like everything they heard on the conference call.""
Estee Lauder's third-quarter earnings report beat analysts' top- and bottom-line estimates, with 13 percent sales growth and a 17 percent boost to net income.
The cosmetics maker's sales grew at double the pace of the broader category. Demand for skin-care products from Estee Lauder's La Mer and Clinique brands helped drive the strength.
But the post-earnings conference call sparked some bearish worries among investors. On the call, Estee Lauder President and CEO Fabrizio Freda indicated that growth in the cosmetics space was starting to level off after years of expansion.
The CEO also disclosed that some claims the company made about how long its makeup stays on weren't entirely accurate.
""It's not the end of the world, but the company's about as well-run as it gets, so the idea that there was a group of rogue employees who [were] basically lying to the customers struck a pretty downbeat chord,"" Cramer said.
Still, Cramer had faith in Freda, who took over as CEO in 2009 after nearly 30 years at Procter & Gamble .
As one of the only high-level consumer goods executives in the United States who is foreign-born, Freda had the foresight to make his makeup brand global, not anchored in U.S. department stores like the rest of the industry had been for years, Cramer argued.
But ""Freda didn't just foresee that foreign markets, particularly in Asia, would be critical here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host continued. ""He also understood that social media would drive sales.""
These days, Freda spends much of his time in Asia connecting with social media influencers to find out what kinds of products they want.
Freda has also been building on Estee Lauder's duty-free business, recognizing that airports and tax-free zones were ideal places for capturing customers from the emerging wealthy classes in South Korea, China, Brazil and the Middle East, Cramer said.
""I think Estee Lauder is riding a wave of selfie-propelled good fortune here,"" Cramer concluded. ""That's why, when its stock's getting clobbered after Freda told us that cosmetics growth was ... leveling off, I think it was necessary to circle back to you right now and recommend this stock into weakness. Estee Lauder's an innovator and a share-taker that's become the best-of-breed by far in its category and I would be a buyer, not a seller.""

6293,Grammy-winning Fugees founder bringing blockchain to your smartphone,"7 Hours Ago | 04:52
Grammy-award winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees Pras Michel is launching a blockchain-enabled smartphone that lets users earn dividends on every purchase.
The phone is part of Michel's digital platform Blacture, which was announced in a 2018 Super Bowl ad, and celebrates black culture through content and technology. The first retail move for Blacture is the launch of Motif, a $300 smartphone that hits stores this fall.
""When you use the phone you'll get paid and you can convert it into cash,"" Michel told CNBC'S "" Squawk Box "" on Friday. ""Blockchain is the technology.""
Michel said Motif users will earn a percentage on every purchase when they pay using their phone, which unlike airline miles can be redeemed for cash. The phone can also be linked to a Blacture debit card. Motif partnered with tech company Zippie, and Michel said the group is in talks with the top four U.S. phone carriers.
Michel founded the Fugees with Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill, and the group went on to win two Grammys for ""Killing Me Softly"" in 1996. The rapper wouldn't say whether or not he owns any cryptocurrency. But Michel knew about it well before bitcoin's meteoric rise to $20,000 last year.
""A friend of mine introduced bitcoin to me when it was at 11 cents,"" he said. ""I didn't believe in it then.""
Bitcoin was the first use-case for blockchain but advocates say the technology has the power to disrupt industries from health care to the music business. In a blockchain, transactions are recorded on what's known as a ""distributed ledger,"" which can be accessed but not altered by the public.
Michel's phone is not the only one using blockchain technology. Foxconn is making one for Sirin Labs called the ""Finney,"" which reportedly ships in October.",2018-05-18T16:15:00.000+03:00
1148,The one simple action that helps self-made billionaire Richard Branson achieve success,"For those trying to fulfill their full potential this year, Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson shares what he does to meet his goals: taking down notes.
""I can't tell you where I'd be if I hadn't had a pen on hand to write down my ideas (or more importantly, other people's) as soon as they came to me,"" he wrote in a recent blog post .
""Some of Virgin's most successful companies have been born from random moments,"" Branson wrote. ""If we hadn't opened our notebooks, they would never have happened.""
Don’t be afraid to dream big in #2018
A post shared by Richard Branson (@richardbranson) on Jan 3, 2018 at 1:24am PST
Branson attributed the rise of Virgin's most successful companies, such as Virgin Trains and Virgin America , to his knack for opening up his notebook and writing down the random thoughts that led to those companies' creation.
The business mogul warns that ""if you don't write your ideas down, they could leave your head before you even leave the room.""
In Branson's experience, most people in leadership roles don't take notes. In fact, he finds that a lot of people think writing notes is below them, ""but everyone should be doing it as it can greatly improve what you do,"" he said.
show chapters This is why self-made millionaire Marcus Lemonis doesn’t make New Year’s resolutions 11:28 AM ET Sat, 30 Dec 2017 | 01:01 Branson recalled a recent time he was in South Africa speaking with the manager of one of his properties. As a result of not taking down notes during their conversation, the manager failed to take action on what he and Branson had previously discussed.
""If you don't write things down it's really easy to forget what was said – and often in business, it's the little things that make a big difference to your customer,"" Branson said. ""Keep a notebook in your back pocket to scribble down thoughts or feedback and make sure you follow through on them in a timely fashion.""
Branson said he has always made lists of things he wants to achieve as it helps him make sense of his ideas and track his progress.
For 2018, Branson's goal is to continue preparing for his space travels through his company Virgin Galactic, according to the post:
Get unbelievably fit so I'm ready for a trip into space. I'll be doing lots of trekking and biking to get me into top shape. When I finished the Virgin Strive Challenge in 2016 I felt like a 25-year-old again – I hadn't felt that good in 40 years. I'll also be doing some centrifuge g-force training so I'm as acclimatized as I can be for the journey.
While sharing your goals with your family and friends is helpful, Branson noted it's ultimately up to you to follow through. Another trick to making goals is to set both short-term and long-term ones so you can feel a sense of accomplishment along the way, Branson wrote.
""If you set daily goals and work through your list every day, you can mark off every completed task with a satisfying tick,"" Branson explained. ""This helps keep you motivated to aim for the big targets.""
That ""satisfying tick"" is one way Branson recommends that you ""celebrate all the little wins,"" but more importantly, continue writing more lists after you meet your goals.
""No matter how big, small, simple or complex an idea is, get it in writing. But don't just take notes for the sake of taking notes, go through your ideas and turn them into actionable and measurable goals,"" Branson said.

3261,Art Cashin: Wall Street's rebound shows that investors are getting used to Trump's 'Art of the Deal',"2 Hours Ago | 03:34 
Wall Street is catching on to President Donald Trump 's ""dramatic"" approach to dealmaking, veteran trader Art Cashin told CNBC on Monday. 
""I think the markets [are] beginning to understand the 'Art of the Deal' in the president's mind,"" said Cashin, the UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange. 
""You start off first with something very dramatic"" as a starting point for negotiations, and then there's room to scale back, Cashin added. 
As an example, Cashin referred to Trump's tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, which had pressured the market right after the March 1 announcement. 
But shortly after, Trump said he would exempt U.S. trading partners Canada and Mexico . And then last week , the administration said it would grant the European Union, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea exemptions as well. 
The tariffs ""sounded like they were going to be big and originally nobody was going to be exempted,"" Cashin told "" Squawk on the Street ."" ""Now everyone is exempted."" 
Cashin also sees the same stick-and-carrot dynamic developing in regards to China. 
Following Trump's announcement last week of up to $60 billion in tariffs against Chinese imports and Beijing's $3 billion retaliation, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said over the weekend he's optimistic a trade agreement will ultimately be negotiated with China. 
""You got help from Secretary Mnuchin ... about trade wars really being in negotiation,"" cited Cashin as a reason the stock market opened so strongly on Monday following Thursday's and Friday's sharp decline. China announcing a willingness to hold talks with the U.S. in order to resolve their differences also helped support stocks. 
Cashin said the markets will continue to feel ""optimistic"" until there's a retest of the Feb. 8 closing lows or there's a real breakthrough to the upside.

574,UPDATE 1-China's Didi Chuxing buys control of Brazil's 99 ride-hailing app,"UPDATE 1-China's Didi Chuxing buys control of Brazil's 99 ride-hailing app Published 21 Hours Ago SHARES 
(Updates with official confirmation) 
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - China's ride-hailing application Didi Chuxing has agreed to acquire control of Brazil's 99, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday, potentially creating a formidable rival to Uber in Latin America's largest economy. 
The companies did not disclose the stake acquired not the value, but an earlier report by Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico on Wednesday said the deal valued 99 at $1 billion. 
According to the paper, which cited sources familiar with talks, the Chinese company bought out investors such as Riverwood Capital, Monashees Inc., Qualcomm Ventures, Tiger Global Management LLC and Softbank Group Corp. 
The acquisition intensifies Didi's global rivalry with Uber, especially in Latin America. Reuters reported in December that Didi plans to enter Mexico this year. 
Cheng Wei, founder and CEO of Didi, said in Wednesday's statement that ""globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi."" 
Didi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. 
One source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. 
Riverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and Soft Bank Group did not reply to requests for comment. 
Didi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. 
In December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.

3769,"April is usually good for stocks, but it comes at a dicey time","Market Insider April is usually good for stocks, but it comes at a dicey time April is usually a good month for stocks, but there are plenty of reasons why it could be cruel this year. In the week ahead, markets will watch for the March jobs report, but also the same worries that made for volatile trading in February and March — including trade wars. April is normally the second-best month of the year, but in years when there is a mid-term election, it often is weak for stocks. 15 Hours Ago | 01:06 
April is usually a good month for stocks, but there are plenty of reasons why it could be cruel this year. 
As markets leave behind the volatile months of February and March, worries that helped drive stocks lower continue to hang over April. Trade tensions are unresolved, and tech weakness remains a concern as does uncertainty around White House personnel and the Russia investigation. The Fed is steady on its course to raise interest rates two or more times this year. 
The big event in the coming week is the March employment report on Friday. Economists expect about 200,000 jobs and a pickup in wages of 0.3 percent. The employment rate could slip a notch to 4 percent. 
But traders were already taking what sounds like good news and spinning it into the next big fear — rising inflation that could fuel more Fed rate hikes. 
""Everybody's homing in on the payroll data. The rumors are that it's going to be a really big number,"" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS. ""What [traders] want to see is if it's a really big number, will it put pressure on the wages?"" 
April, on average, is the second-best month for the S&P 500 , going back to World War II, but the problem for this April is that it comes during a midterm election year. In those years, the second quarter is often weak for stocks, as is the third. 
""April is actually the second-best month of the year, and it has risen 69 percent of the time,"" said Samuel Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""The average price gain is 1.4 percent, versus 0.67 percent for all months."" 
But it could face other headwinds this year. 
""While normally the second quarter is a positive quarter for the market, up 1.8 percent since World War II, it's down an average 2.2 percent during midterm election years, and it doesn't get much better in the third quarter,"" Stovall said. He said the weakness comes amid concerns that the party in power could lose its majority. 
""Like the old saying, the best house on a bad block. It could be the best month in a bad quarter,"" he said. 
For March, the S&P 500 lost 2.7 percent, and it was down 1.2 percent for the quarter. The Nasdaq, hit hard in March by tech weakness, lost 2.9 percent but it was still positive for the quarter, up 2.3 percent. 
Traders have been watching the 200-day moving average, which is a key technical support level for the index, at 2,589 Thursday. Watched as an indicator of price trends, the 200-day is simply an average of the closing value of the last 200 trading days. 
The S&P bounced from that level in February and again last Monday . But it's an area that traders continue to watch for a possible retest. 
""Equity markets have been experiencing extreme moves both up and down all week, but the near-term trend that's in place is pointed downward instead of upward,"" Bespoke said in a note. ""Thus far, the S&P 500 has managed to hold support above its 200-day moving average, but the more the 200-day gets tested, the more likely it is to ultimately break."" 
Stovall said another worry that's been nagging at the market is the ever-narrowing difference in yields between longer- and shorter-duration Treasurys. That distance between the yield on the 2-year and the 10-year Treasury has been flattening, to just 47 basis points Thursday, the lowest since October 2007. 
The concern is that a 'flat' curve is leading to an inverted curve, where the 2-year, at 2.26 percent, would rise above the 10-year, now at 2.73 percent. That would be a warning of a coming recession, but for now many strategists do not believe it is yet signaling a downturn. 
Credit concerns have been circling the markets, as traders watch the ticking up of Libor rates. The London interbank offered rate is the rate at which banks lend to each other. 
Analysts say changes in U.S. tax law have changed the way corporations treat short-term securities, and that and a high volume of U.S. Treasury securities has created a market imbalance, forcing Libor to rise. In itself, it is not considered an issue, since it is seen as technical, but traditionally the rate has been watched as an indicator for financial stress. 
Spreads have risen in other markets, and the focus in the past week was on the high yield market, where Tesla's debt downgrade sent its yield spiking. Analysts said Tesla did not affect other names. 
Oleg Melentyev, head of U.S. high-yield credit strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said he sees high yield holding up well relative to other asset classes. ""However, stability is not immune to how long volatility episodes last, and in a scenario where, let's say, equities were down 10 percent from here, I cannot imagine an outcome where HY does not take a real hit,"" he wrote in an email. 
""Aside from that, issuer fundamentals are actually in decent shape, and we think this cycle has more to go before it turns, which at the end of the day is what matters the most to this asset class,"" he added. ""A tail risk I am watching here is what is going on in some large IG [investment grade] capital structures, like GE , where bonds are now trading at 105 bps spreads, up from 40 just a few months ago. It's still a single-A rated issuer, and it has 30 bps to go before it trades like an average BBB."" What to Watch ",2018-03-30T00:21:00.000+03:00
3736,Mexican auto production and exports are surging as NAFTA talks drag on,"Mexican auto production and exports are surging as NAFTA talks drag on The Mexican Automotive Industry Association shows exports to the U.S. in 2018 are up 9.5 percent. Auto production in Mexico rose 6.2 percent through the first two months of the year. At that pace, t he country is on pace to produce more than 4 million vehicles annually for the first time ever. Brett Gundlock | Bloomberg | Getty Images Vehicles stand in a lot before export at the Port of Veracruz in Veracruz, Mexico. 
While President Donald Trump and his negotiators press Mexico for changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement, auto plants south of the border are cranking out vehicles at a record pace. New data from the Mexican Automotive Industry Association shows exports to the U.S. in 2018 are up 9.5 percent. That is a faster pace of growth than that of all auto exports from Mexico so far this year. 
Meanwhile, auto production in Mexico is up 6.2 percent through the first two months of the year. The country is on pace to produce more than 4 million vehicles annually for the first time ever. The numbers are not surprising since most automakers have not slowed down production in Mexico, despite threats from Trump to slap punitive taxes on cars and trucks built in Mexico and exported to the U.S. 
In early 2017, the president tweeted, "" Toyota Motor said will build new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax!"" Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. 
A few months after that tweet was sent out, Toyota announced plans to expand production in the U.S. It was one of several auto companies, including BMW , General Motors , Ford and Fiat Chrysler to announce hefty investments and production increases for its operations in the United States. While automakers are planning more production in the U.S., they are still expanding south of the border. Both General Motors and Fiat Chrysler increased production in Mexico last year by 14.6 percent and 39.1 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, Mercedes is planning to open a plant in that country later this year and BMW will be opening its first Mexican auto plant next year.

853,This financial advisor is riding the bitcoin roller coaster,"By now, even your grandmother probably knows what a bitcoin is. If that's not a sign of something going mainstream, I don't know what is.
As a financial advisor, I've found it interesting these past months to talk about bitcoin in a professional setting. When I do, I always explain that, no matter how exciting the ""crypto-hysteria"" may seem, it is speculative. Ultimately, one must remember the intimate relationship between risk and reward. Ignore it, and you could find yourself disappointed or, even worse, broke.
Most of my clients don't know this, but I've personally owned bitcoin since 2014. My stash sits securely in my digital wallet, untouched since the day it was deposited there. Back then, I split the cost of a glorified computer — called a ""miner"" — with a childhood friend, and this machine generated us a finite amount of digital money. So long before your grandma knew what a bitcoin was, I've been riding this roller coaster.

So you're a 401(k) ""millionairess."" Now what?

Don't put all your financial eggs in one investment basket
However, I've been keeping mum about my position in bitcoin for two reasons. First and foremost, from both an advisory and compliance standpoint, this subject is under strict regulatory scrutiny; it's a bad look in either department to rant and rave about speculative trends. Second, I had not quite figured out how to use my bitcoin experience in a way that would be constructive for my clients. The last thing I'd want is for my story to unduly color their biases. But now, more than a few years in, I think I've extracted the lesson to share with them and everyone else.
From the beginning, I thought about our miner as form of entertainment — never as an investment. The cost of the machine was something I could afford, and I was excited to embark on another adventure with an old friend (who happens to be a neuroscientist with a knack for these things). I cut the check like I had just left an ATM in Vegas, prepared to hand over my money to either hit it big or crap out. I'd be lucky to come out on top, but most importantly, I never play with more money than I am willing to lose.

1982,Georgia just handed Atlanta a new political problem in bid for Amazon HQ2,"Georgia's Senate passed a bill Friday that won't necessarily help Atlanta's chances of landing Amazon HQ2, the second North American headquarters for the technology giant that 20 metro areas are vying for with a decision expected from Amazon by year end.
The Georgia bill, called Senate Bill 375 , or the ""Keep Faith in Adoption and Foster Care Act,"" allows adoption agencies funded by tax dollars to decline referrals if doing so would violate ""sincerely held religious beliefs.""
The bill's sponsors claim it will encourage more adoption agencies to open in Georgia, but opponents argue it is nothing more than a way to discriminate against same-sex couples looking to adopt or provide foster care. The bill would also allow agencies to deny services to LGBTQ youth.
""Senate Bill 375 is a dangerous step backward that would codify permission to discriminate against the LGBTQ community into Georgia state law,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, in a statement . ""This bill is not about freedom of religion, which is one of our nation's fundamental values, but rather about imposing one's personal religious beliefs on others to discriminate against loving foster or adoptive parents simply because of their identity and deny services to LGBTQ youth.""
show chapters Fed's Kashkari says Amazon's HQ2 winner will lose      9:10 AM ET Fri, 2 Feb 2018 | 00:29 The bill now heads to the Georgia House.
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a bill in 2016 that would have allowed faith-based organizations to discriminate based on religious beliefs.
Amazon, a company known for its progressive nature , includes ""cultural community fit"" in its list of factors for deciding on HQ2. Georgia already lacks nondiscrimination laws for LBGTQ citizens.
The City of Atlanta's Office of the Mayor declined comment. The city does have a record of support for the LGBTQ community and earned its fifth-consecutive perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Municipal Equality Index in 2017. Atlanta was the only city in Georgia to receive a perfect score on the index. 
An Amazon spokesman declined to comment but referred to the requirements cited by the company in its Request for Proposal for cultural community fit . The RFP states, ""This includes the presence and support of a diverse population, excellent institutions of higher education, local government structure and elected officials eager and willing to work with the company, among other attributes.""
More than half of the 20 metro areas in the running for Amazon HQ2 are in states that lack LGBTQ nondiscrimination laws. Critics say that is reason enough to compel Amazon to not select any of those cities, even if they are blue cities in red states. Others, even some LGBTQ advocacy groups, argue that bringing Amazon into one of these states could lead to the development of a more progressive population and politics.
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings conceded to CNBC in an interview earlier this year that it is among the Amazon HQ2 finalist cities with a ""blue city in a red state"" problem.

General Electric will restate its earnings for 2016 and 2017 as it adopts a new accounting standard, according to a regulatory filing Friday. 
The updated accounting standard, which will take into account revenue from long-term contracts, will result in a 13 cent cut in reported earnings per share for 2016 and a cut of 16 cents per share for 2017, according to the company's 10-K filing. 
The company will restate earnings when it reports 2018 results, GE said in the filing. GE reports first-quarter earnings on April 20. 
GE is adopting the new accounting standards as the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating GE over its accounting for long-term service contracts.

5919,Viacom asks CBS to raise its bid by $2.8 billion,"Viacom has asked CBS to sweeten its merger bid by about $2.8 billion or almost a quarter more than CBS's offer, people familiar with the matter said, indicating the wide gap in the U.S. media firms' price expectations.
National Amusements, the Redstone family company that controls CBS and Viacom, has pushed the two sides to negotiate a merger by forming independent board committees. Viacom's request shows how the companies have yet to make progress in their talks.
In a letter to CBS delivered Thursday night, Viacom asked for 0.68 CBS shares for each Viacom class B share, the sources said. the counteroffer gives Viacom holders a 41.5 percent stake. CBS had offered 0.55 of its shares for each Viacom class B share.
CBS is now considering its next steps in the deal negotiations, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because Viacom's request is confidential. It has not responded to the counteroffer.
CBS and Viacom declined to comment.
Viacom announced Monday it is moving its earnings release up a few days to April 25.
At CBS's proposed share exchange ratio of 0.55, Viacom would be valued at $11.9 billion, below its current market capitalization of $12.7 billion. Viacom's counterproposal values the company at $14.7 billion.
Viacom shares have risen about a third since early November on speculation of new efforts to merge CBS with Viacom, after the previous round of negotiations in 2016 ended unsuccessfully.
In its letter to CBS last week, Viacom also asked for its CEO Robert Bakish to be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, a demand supported by National Amusements, according to the sources.
CBS has asked for its chief operating officer, Joseph Ianniello, to have that role instead, the sources said.
Both CBS and Viacom agree that CBS CEO Les Moonves should lead the combined company, according to the sources.
The merger would combine CBS' television network, local TV stations and Showtime cable network with Viacom's cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon, as well as Viacom's Paramount Pictures film studio.
The pressure on the media sector to consolidate has increased following AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner and Walt Disney's recent deal to buy some Twenty-First Century Fox's assets for $52.4 billion.
Combined, CBS and Viacom would have more leverage to negotiate prices for their programming with U.S. cable and satellite companies, which face a decline in their subscriber base amid fierce competition against media streaming companies, such as Netflix . But sources said CBS sees Viacom's estimated $1 billion in cost synergies to be ""way off.""

Ahead of Schlumberger 's quarterly earnings report Friday before the market opens, I'm optimistic on the name — and it's not just due to the recent surge in crude prices. 
Right now, we're in this unique period of fiscal easing and monetary tightening happening at the same time, and we feel that the benefits of tax cuts and infrastructure spending will actually offset the Fed's plans to hike rates. 
Since World War II, there have been seven periods like this; the two best-performing sectors under these conditions have been energy and financials. 
Schlumberger, one of the top holdings in the energy-tracking XLE , is the largest oil services field play in the world. With a presence in every single energy market in the world, it's definitely a stock that you want to keep your eyes on. 
Strong global growth and good supply-and-demand fundamentals have really kept a good, solid floor under oil prices, but the surprising part of the rally in oil prices is that energy stocks have lagged. 
In this earnings report, we're really looking to see two things happen. 
The energy sector should begin to catch up to the rise in oil prices, and Schlumberger in particular should begin to experience some mean reversion with regard to its stock performance. 
The biggest thing to pay attention to is any discussion at all on the impact of rising rig counts. Oil and gas rigs have increased by more than 20 percent year over year, yet Schlumberger has lagged. 
Therefore, we see significant upside potential with this stock, to the tune of at least 20 percent, and we think it will get back on the right track.",2018-04-19T23:59:00.000+03:00

A plurality would choose the responsible option: 36 percent say they'd use it to pay down their debt , the survey notes, ""whether it was credit-card based, or from an existing mortgage or loan.""
That finding makes sense: Total credit card debt has reached a high point , according to a report from the Federal Reserve, surpassing $1 trillion in 2017. The average American has a balance of $6,375, Experian data shows, up nearly 3 percent from last year.

6614,Cramer fears Fed raising rates too quickly will halt a 'red hot' economy,"CNBC's Jim Cramer warned on Thursday that if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too quickly it could spell bad news for the ""red hot"" U.S. economy.
Cramer said Wall Street expected that the Fed wouldn't need to raise rates too aggressively after this month's weaker-than-expected jobs report , which showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 164,000 in April, less than the 192,000 jobs expected. Average hourly earnings also rose less than expected.
But Cramer said that now he's worried the central bank could raise rates faster than expected after the release of U.S. jobless claims data by the Labor Department on Thursday morning.
""The four-week moving average of these numbers fell by 2,750 to a little over 213,000,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""That's the lowest jobless claims figure since December 1969, when we had a 120 million fewer people in this country.""
The four-week moving average is viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility.
The Fed, led by Jerome Powell in his first meeting as chairman, approved a widely expected quarter-point hike in March. The decision put the new benchmark funds rate at a target of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.
The probability that the central bank will raise its benchmark rate at its FOMC meeting in June is at 95 percent, according to the CME's FedWatch tracking tool for the fed funds futures market.
Cramer acknowledged that the U.S. economy needs higher interest rates to stave off inflation. However, Cramer added that higher rates also make it more expensive to borrow money and thus slow down the economy.
""In other words, when the economy gets too hot, we have these mechanisms in place that will cause it to cool back down, and that's where you might get hurt,"" Cramer said.

6002,"Hurricane Maria's death toll could exceed 4,600, study estimates","The official death count from Hurricane Maria is 64. The real number could exceed more than 4,600, mostly due to delayed or interrupted medical care, according to a new study.
Media reports have suggested the official count is far lower than what has actually occurred in the wake of the powerful storm that struck Puerto Rico in September. The storm left many stranded without electricity and unable to access health care.
A group of independent researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other institutions surveyed more than 3,000 households in Puerto Rico in an attempt to overcome challenges of relying on death certificates to measure the total.
Of the households they visited, 38 people died between Sept. 20, when Hurricane Maria struck, and the end of the year, according to the study, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . Of these deaths, one-third were attributed to delayed or interrupted health care.
The researchers used these measures to calculate the mortality rate and apply it to the larger population to reach their estimate. While their estimate is substantially higher than the official tally, researchers said it's still likely to be conservative.
When adjusting for survivor bias and household-size distributions, the estimate increases to more than 5,000, they said.
The findings are likely to ramp up criticism of preparations and responses to natural disasters. Researchers said health-care disruption is now a growing contributor to both morbidity and mortality during these events.
About 14 percent of households surveyed said they weren't able to access medications, while nearly 10 percent said they needed respiratory equipment that required electricity. Other problems included closed medical facilities and absent doctors.
Meanwhile, the official death count could change. Facing pressure, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello ordered a review in December. President Donald Trump has said the total shows the federal government responded well to the storm compared to a ""real catastrophe like (Hurricane) Katrina.""
Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in a statement the government of Puerto Rico welcomes the new Harvard-led survey and looks forward to analyzing it.
""As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities,"" Mercader said. ""We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported.""",2018-05-29T19:49:00.000+03:00

3847,U.S. lawmakers seek overhaul of overseas food aid rules,"U.S. lawmakers seek overhaul of overseas food aid rules Patricia Zengerle Published 1 Hour Ago Reuters 
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers launched their latest effort on Wednesday to ease restrictions on international food assistance programs, which they say would free hundreds of millions of dollars a year and get aid to millions more hungry people around the world. 
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives introduced the ""Food for Peace Modernization Act of 2018"" which they want to include in the 2018 farm bill, a giant piece of legislation governing U.S. agriculture. 
Among other things, the bill would end a requirement that 100 percent of food aid commodities be produced in the United States, changing it to 25 percent. 
This, the sponsors argue, would drastically cut the amount of food aid money spent on overhead costs like shipping. 
The measure would also end a requirement to ""monetize"" food aid, which the bill's sponsors described as a process in which aid groups must sell U.S. food overseas and use proceeds of those sales to fund development programs. 
Lawmakers have been pushing to reform the U.S. overseas food aid system for years. 
Supporters have fought successfully to keep the current system in place, arguing that it supports U.S. agriculture and shipping. 
Advocates of reform say food aid represents only 0.2 percent of total U.S. agricultural output, a percentage so small that changing the rules would not have a significant effect on the industry. 
""At no extra taxpayer expense, we can put more food into food aid and have it arrive months faster to feed millions of additional starving people without lessening the critical role of American farmers,"" Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a bill sponsor, said in a statement. 
The measure is also sponsored in the Senate by Democrat Chris Coons. Similar legislation was introduced in the House on Wednesday by Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Democratic Representative Earl Blumenauer.

2368,Cramer: This security going 'haywire' after hours is going to pressure the whole stock market on Tuesday,"Stocks will add to their losses on Tuesday as an obscure security linked to market volatility loses nearly all of its value, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday.
The investor was referring to the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note (XIV) . The XIV — which allows traders to bet against the Cboe Volatility index ( VIX ) — tanked more than 80 percent in after-hours trading. The sharp move lower sparked fear among traders that violent declines like this one would cause market volatility measures to spike further and pressure on the broader market.
""That's the instrument that's going haywire,"" Cramer said during a CNBC special report. ""It is blowing up as we speak.""
""It should put downward pressure on the stock market at the opening, should spike the VIX to 50 and then cause the market to go down,"" he said.
The VIX, which is widely considered the best fear gauge in the market, more than doubled on Monday, surging to 37.32 from 17.16 in the previous session.
The XIV is supposed to track the inverse return of the VIX, hence the problem.

Stocks tanked on fell sharply on Monday. The S&P 500 shed 4.1 percent, marking its biggest one-day sell-off since August 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back 1,175.21 points. Both indexes erased their gains for 2018.
But Cramer also said investors should treat this retreat as a buying opportunity. The major indexes had risen to all-time highs prior to their recent pullback.

4780,Venture capital firm co-founder: I wanted to 'solve my own personal pain point',"A personal dissatisfaction with an old boys' club mentality in venture capital led Pocket Sun to co-found what she calls the first female-led millennial venture capital firm.
""The venture capital industry is extremely male-dominated and I saw a lot of female entrepreneurs who were undervalued and undercapitalized,"" Sun, co-founder of SoGal Ventures told CNBC. Her firm was started by capitalizing on gender inequality, she added, to change the status quo in the industry.
SoGal has gone on to make 52 investments in the past two and a half years, but the executive said she did not always expect to head down that path.
""I would say I did not plan on going on this path at all,"" Sun said. ""When I started SoGal, it was really to solve my own personal pain point. I wanted to see more women in venture capital events and entrepreneurship events.""
The dream grew bigger, however, and turned into a desire to create an empire for future generations of women to play a central role in the industry, Sun told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Credit Suisse Global Megatrends Conference in Singapore.
""So now, three years later, we've had 52 investments under our belt, which is just unbelievable. So we are onto bigger things — it really started from humble beginnings,"" Sun said.

2950,Kushner Cos. filed false NYC housing paperwork,"When the Kushner Cos . bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.
But that's exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed. Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.
Now a clue has emerged as to how President Donald Trump's son-in-law's firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.
While none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.
""It's bare-faced greed,"" said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants' rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. ""The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.""
Kushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and ""if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.""
""Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights,"" it said, adding that the company ""has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.""
For the three Queens buildings in the borough's Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.
In all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.
Had the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled ""sweeps"" on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.
Instead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.
""It was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice,"" said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that he also bristled at a 60 percent rent increase, a hike the Kushner Cos. contends was initiated by the previous landord. ""They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.""
Tax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.
In Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.
At a six-story walk-up in Manhattan's East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.
""All of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. ... You heard the drilling in the middle of night,"" said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. ""There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.""
A knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.
""I know it's pretty horrible, but we can help you get out,"" Siwek recalls the man saying. ""We can offer you money.""
Siwek turned down the cash and sued instead. She said she won a year's worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.
New York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: ""The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction.""
Rent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings. To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.
Submitting false documents to the city's Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an ""amended"" form with the correct numbers.
Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.
""There is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement,"" said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, ""you're going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.""
New York City's Department of Buildings did not comment in general about the false filings by the Kushner Cos., but said it disciplined a contractor who filed false documents while working on two of the Queens buildings, which are currently under investigation by a tenant-harassment task force. It added that the department is also ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors under city laws recently passed to crack down on tenant harassment.
""We won't tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants -- no matter who they are,"" spokesman Joseph Soldevere said.
Exactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.
Jared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House , sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.
Back in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.
He hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the 60-percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And he said his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.
Romano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days -- the mice.

5625,New York Fed chief Dudley sees two risks ahead for interest rate policy,"Ashlee Espinal | Reuters William C. Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
Uncertainties surrounding trade and the federal budget will be the main challenges to Federal Reserve policymakers, outgoing New York Fed President William Dudley said Wednesday. 
As he prepares to leave his position in June, Dudley said in a speech that he feels confident that the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee is close to its objective of full employment and price stability. 
However, the threat of a trade war and a fiscal situation that is threatening to spin out of control are expected to pose challenges. 
""On a personal level, I am pleased that I will be leaving my current position at a time when the FOMC is likely to be very close to its employment and inflation objectives — recognizing, of course, the terrible damage of the financial crisis and the long time it has taken to get here,"" Dudley said during a speech at Lehman College in the Bronx. ""Uncertainty about trade policy and the fact that we are now on an unsustainable fiscal path, however, have raised the longer-term risks."" 
Dudley indicated that, absent major disruptions from policy, the best bet for the Fed will be to continue with rate increases until it reaches a neutral level that is neither overly stimulative nor restrictive. 
He figures that will be around 3 percent, which would point to six more quarter-point hikes before the Fed pauses. That assumes the continuation of current economic conditions, which he called ""quite favorable."" 
However, he said his colleagues will have to monitor the risks now and after he is gone. 
""Over time, how U.S. trade policy evolves will have important implications for the performance of the U.S. economy — and, by extension, for U.S. monetary policy,"" he said. ""By increasing uncertainty around the economic outlook, these shifts in fiscal and trade policy could make it more difficult for the FOMC to achieve its dual mandate objectives in the years ahead."" 
On a related issue, Dudley addressed some internal deliberations over how the Fed should target and carry out its goals. Several schools of thought have emerged, but Dudley recommended the Fed maintain its current policy of using the rate it pays on excess reserves to control the target funds rate that the committee uses as its benchmark.",2018-04-18T22:15:00.000+03:00

2455,SEC charges former bitcoin exchange and its founder with fraud,"Gold SEC charges former bitcoin exchange and its founder with fraud Bitcoin exchange BitFunder and its founder ran the site as an ""unregistered securities exchange"" and defrauded users of that exchange, according to the SEC. The site shut down just one year after launching in 2012. The charges highlight uncertainty surrounding whether or not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. Jim Bourg | Reuters The Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged former cryptocurrency exchange BitFunder and its founder with fraud Wednesday. 
The regulator alleged that BitFunder and founder Jon E. Montroll ran the operation as an ""unregistered securities exchange"" and defrauded users of that exchange, according to a SEC statement. 
""Platforms that engage in the activity of a national securities exchange, regardless of whether that activity involves digital assets, tokens, or coins, must register with the SEC or operate pursuant to an exemption,"" Marc Berger, director of the SEC's New York Regional Office, said in a statement. 
Montroll also failed to disclose a cyberattack on the exchange's system and a bitcoin theft that happened as a result, according to the SEC statement. 
""We will continue to vigorously police conduct involving distributed ledger technology and ensure that bad actors who commit fraud in this space are held accountable,"" Lara S. Mehraban, Associate Regional Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office said in the statement. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York also filed a complaint against Montroll Wednesday for ""perjury and obstruction of justice during the SEC's investigation,"" according to the statement. 
A lawyer for Montroll couldn't immediately be reached. 
BitFunder closed just a one year after its launch in December 2012. The site's shutdown followed the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange shutdown in October 2012 and btct.co's shutdown in October 2013. 
The charges highlight uncertainty surrounding whether or not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities. It's unclear whether the coins are utility tokens or securities that would fall under the SEC's oversight, and many start-ups have barred U.S. residents from officially participating in token sales as a result. 
The regulator has stepped up its crackdown on cryptocurrency-related fraud in the last eight months, with a series of investor bulletins, stock trading suspensions and initial coin offering halts. 
Just last Friday, the commission temporarily suspended trading in three tiny stocks due to questions about recent announcements involving blockchain and cryptocurrency investments. And in late January, the SEC halted and froze the assets of AriseBank, which claimed to have raised $600 million in the largest initial coin offering to date. 
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has also spoken out more about cryptocurrencies. He said earlier this month in a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee that federal financial agencies may ask Congress for increased legislation on cryptocurrency-related operations. He added that he is ""not satisfied"" when people think cryptocurrency trading platforms have the same protection as a stock exchange.

In a blog post late Tuesday, the social network said it will:
Ask users whether they want Facebook to use data from partners , such as other websites, to show them ads. Ask users to choose whether to continue sharing information such as your political and religious views and relationship status. Start allowing facial recognition technology if users wish to. This is used to suggest friends you may want to tag in photos and also detect when others might be attempting to use an image you have uploaded as their profile picture. Facebook turned off this feature for Europe in 2012 after pressure from regulators and privacy campaigners. Ask people to agree to Facebook's updated terms of service and data policy. ""We're not asking for new rights to collect, use or share your data on Facebook, and we continue to commit that we do not sell information about you to advertisers or other partners,"" Facebook said in a blog post Tuesday.
European Union users will start seeing these requests this week and they will eventually be rolled out globally.
""We'll present the information in the ways that make the most sense for other regions,"" Facebook said.
Facebook's announcement comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25. It replaces a more than two decade year old data law and requires companies to give users more control over their data. Here's everything you need to know about GDPR .

PepsiCo – The beverage and snack maker beat estimates by a penny a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.31 . Revenue also beat forecasts. The company reported better-than-expected organic revenue growth, raised its annual dividend by 15 percent, and forecast 2018 adjusted earnings of $5.70 per share, 3 cents a share above estimates.
Under Armour – The athletic apparel maker reported a breakeven quarter on an adjusted basis, matching Street forecasts . Revenue topped consensus. North American sales fell, but that was offset by a strong performance internationally. Under Armour also announced an expansion of a previously announced restructuring program, saying it saw more opportunities to optimize its operations.
Blue Apron – The meal kit service lost 20 cents per share for the fourth quarter , smaller than the 27 cent a share loss that Wall Street was anticipating. Revenue beat consensus, despite a drop in its customer base. Results were aided by a decline in marketing expenses.
Generac – The maker of power generators earned an adjusted $1.37 per share for the fourth quarter, beating the $1.19 a share consensus estimate. Revenue also topped forecasts, with shipments of home standby generators near record levels thanks to elevated power outage activity.
GNC Holdings – The health products retailer matched estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of 25 cents per share. Revenue fell short of forecasts, despite a same-store sales increase of 5.7 percent. The company said it is seeing positive results from its revamped pricing model and enhanced loyalty programs.
AmerisourceBergen — Walgreens Boots Alliance has reached out to the drug distributor about a possible takeover , according to The Wall Street Journal, but the talks are in an early stage and no deal will necessarily be reached. Walgreens already owns about 26 percent of AmerisourceBergen and has a representative on the board of directors.

Barnes & Noble – The book retailer is cutting staff by an unspecified amount , following a weak holiday season that saw comparable-store sales drop by 6.4 percent.
JPMorgan Chase – The bank was upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""market perform"" at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, which said the recent sell-off is a chance to add quality to portfolios at reasonable valuations and that JPMorgan now has a favorable risk/reward profile at current prices.
Quest Diagnostics – Quest was upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"" at Credit Suisse, which points to the medical lab operator's opportunities to promote growth in that business.
Dun & Bradstreet – The company reported quarterly profit of $3.22 per share, 18 cents above estimates, though revenue was short of forecasts.

537,The 5 states with the highest and lowest paid politicians,"If you think that politicians make a lot of money, you would be right — and also wrong. The amount that states pay governors, congressmen and senators varies greatly.
For instance, Zippia reports that the governor of Pennsylvania is paid approximately $187,818 a year, and the governor of Maine is paid $70,000. They found that the range is even more pronounced among state representatives. In California, state representatives make close to $100,000 a year while representatives from New Hampshire are paid just $100 a year.
Zippia analyzed data from 50 states in order to calculate how much each state paid politicians. The site considered three factors: cost of living , governor's wage and state representative wages . Since states pay their representatives differently, Zippia calculated their wages by adding their base pay and estimating per diem allowances that would be provided over the length of the average session. Zippia's data is from 2014, and does not include expenses. 




Here are the five states that pay their politicians the most:
5. West Virginia Governor salary: $150,000
State representative salary: $27,860.
4. Michigan Governor salary: $159,300
State representative salary: $71,685
3. Tennessee Governor salary: $181,980
State representative salary: $38,704
2. Ohio Governor salary: $148,886

Pennsylvania pays their governors more than any other state and pays their representatives more than every state except for California.
California actually has the highest paid representatives, but did not crack the top five because of the high cost of living in the golden state. Governors of California are paid the seventh most in the nation, behind states like Virginia, Illinois and Tennessee.
Zippia calculates that New Hampshire has the lowest paid politicians. In New Hampshire, Governors are paid $121,896 but representatives are paid just $200 for every two-year term and they do not receive per diem wages. That means over the course of a year, a congressperson from New Hampshire would earn just $100.

2806,ANALYSIS-U.S. set to lose top spot as global corn exporter to Brazil,"ANALYSIS-U.S. set to lose top spot as global corn exporter to Brazil Mark Weinraub Published 45 Mins Ago Reuters 
CHICAGO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Brazil could eclipse the United States as the world's top exporter of corn within five years, ending decades of U.S. dominance over the market for one of the worlds basic foodstuffs. 
Brazil is growing in stature as a global agricultural powerhouse. American farmers, who for generations have boasted of being the world's breadbasket, now must struggle with grains prices and aging infrastructure. Washington's efforts to renegotiate trade agreements also could affect exports. 
At the same time, cheaper supplier Brazil is reaping the benefit of massive investment in export infrastructure. In 2012/13, the South American country passed the United States as top soy exporter. Three years later, Russia displaced America as No. 1 wheat supplier. 
""If you look down the road five, 10 years, absolutely Brazil will compete with the United States to be the No. 1 corn exporter in the world,"" said Michael Cordonnier, president of consultancy Soybean and Corn Adviser. 
""They have got the land: hundreds of millions of hectares that can be brought into production; they have got the weather; they have got the know-how. On the agronomic side, there is no limit in sight."" 
Billions of dollars of investments in Brazil's ports, particularly in the more accessible north, have ended years of chronic delays for exporters, making shipments cheaper and more reliable and boosting buying from consumers such as China. In addition to soybeans, Brazil is the top global supplier of beef and sugar. 
Brazil lags the United States in road infrastructure, but gradual improvement in that area is expected. U.S. farmers face their own challenges. A crumbling lock and dam system on Midwest rivers has hurt their reputation as the world's most reliable grain suppliers. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department projects U.S. corn exports will fall by 6.2 million tonnes, valued at around $1 billion, in the current marketing year. Brazil corn exports meanwhile are expected to rise by 1 million tonnes from a year ago, speeding Brazil's ascendancy to top exporter. 
""If we do not look to the future, there will be a point down the road where we are going to get pushed into second place,"" said Fred Helms, a farmer from Illinois who recently toured Brazil and Argentina with the Illinois Farm Bureau to get a sense of the competition. 
""It is not fun to be number two."" 
Brazil's warmer climate gives its farmers a longer growing season than their U.S. counterparts. Most Brazilian growers can seed corn immediately after harvesting soybeans, planting two corn crops per year. U.S. farmers must wait through winter. 
That has led to a jump in Brazilian corn plantings as farmers scramble to boost soybean production to satisfy demand from China, Cordonnier said. 
U.S. corn is expected to account for just 33.8 percent of global corn exports in the 2017/2018 marketing year, down from 62.6 percent a decade ago, according to USDA projections. Brazil's projected corn exports of 35 million tonnes would account for 22.7 percent of global shipments. 
Just 20 years ago, Brazil exported just 6 million tonnes, less than 1 percent of the world total. 
""Ten years ago nobody believed the country would be able to achieve this,"" said Sergio Mendes, director general at Anec, Brazil's national association of cereal exporters. ""Producers in Brazil are very efficient and things happened fast."" 
The most recent data from Brazil's Trade Ministry showed that the country exported 3.02 million tonnes of corn in January, more than double the 1.45 million tonnes it shipped overseas a year earlier. 
'MAINTAIN A PLACE AT THE TABLE' 
The U.S. briefly fell from its perch as top corn exporter in 2012/13, but that was because of drought. The next time Brazil surpasses the United States it will likely be permanent. 
Changes in trade pacts could hasten the decline of U.S. market share. The United States, Canada and Mexico are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). That deal has given U.S. farmers unfettered access to top buyer Mexico, which accounted for 23.8 percent of U.S. corn shipments in the 2016/17 marketing year. Brazilian sellers are already making inroads into Mexico. 
For now, the USDA forecasts the United States will remain the top corn exporter for the next decade but with a market share falling below 30 percent. 
""We are not the only player in the world anymore,"" said Mark Welch, assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M University. 
""It is so critical that the U.S. maintain a place at the table when it comes to trade agreements and trade relationships and trading partnerships.""

5801,"RPT-U.S., China rivalry poses risks, benefits for Latin America","RPT-U.S., China rivalry poses risks, benefits for Latin America Luc Cohen Reuters 
(Repeats with no change in text) 
MENDOZA, Argentina, April 5 (Reuters) - As the trade dispute between the United States and China was gaining steam last month, a half-dozen Chinese dancers and a person in a panda bear suit paraded across a stage inside a hotel lobby in the heart of Argentina's wine country. 
The March 24 ceremony celebrated the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank's (IDB) choice to hold its next annual meeting in Chengdu, China, a decision criticized by the United States, whose regional influence has been increasingly challenged by the Asian economic superpower. 
Just over a week later, China imposed tariffs on a range of U.S. products from frozen pork to wine in response to U.S. President Donald's Trump's decision to place tariffs on steel and aluminum from countries including China. 
The trade fight, which escalated further on Wednesday with China targeting key American imports including soybeans, planes and cars in retaliation for proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, has left Latin America in the middle, analyzing risks and opportunities. 
""The U.S. is forcing countries in the region to choose between the U.S. and China,"" said Margaret Myers, director of the Latin America and the World program at the Inter-American Dialogue. ""It's putting Latin American countries in a very challenging position while at the same time not offering a particularly attractive policy."" 
China, whose demand for raw materials increased during rapid economic growth the past two decades, is already the top trade partner for countries ranging from Brazil, Latin America's largest economy and the world's top soybean exporter, to tiny Uruguay. 
Rather than celebrating a chance to gain market share, Brazil and Argentina responded cautiously to the tariffs on Wednesday. Brazil's Agriculture Ministry declined to comment. Argentina, the world's No. 3 soy exporter, said it was ""analyzing the situation."" 
Analysts in both countries said, however, the tariffs could force China to purchase more soybeans and soy-based products from South America. 
CHINESE LOANS, INVESTMENT 
Latin American countries' turn to China for financing has alarmed Washington even as its own policy toward the region shifts. 
Trump's December 2017 national security strategy said China was seeking to ""pull the region into its orbit through state-led investment and loans."" 
David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury Department's undersecretary for international affairs, said at a March conference in Buenos Aires that China's hosting of next year's IDB meeting ""does not serve the interests of the Western Hemisphere."" 
In response, IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno noted that the IDB would hold a special meeting for the bank's 60th anniversary in Washington next year, saying: ""We have found the best of all worlds."" 
Trump's trade policies and rhetoric about immigration have disturbed even the most U.S.-friendly governments in Latin America. 
Before the United States temporarily exempted Brazil from planned steel tariffs, a Foreign Ministry official said trade relations between the two countries were in ""uncharted waters."" 
Argentina is threatening to take Washington to the World Trade Organization over biodiesel import tariffs. While the United States is the IDB's largest shareholder, it backed out last year of one of the bank's key funds. 
Still, China's perceived disregard for projects' social and environmental costs has generated opposition within Latin America. 
Civil society groups from Ecuador, Argentina and Peru set up an alliance to present information on ""multiple human rights violations"" linked to Chinese investments to the United Nations, according to a February statement from global nonprofit alliance Civicus. 
MORE CHINESE PLAYERS 
Chinese foreign direct investment, or FDI, in the region has increased by $70 billion since 2012, according to the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. While the United States remains the largest source of FDI, its share fell to 20 percent in 2016 from 25.7 percent in 2015 and 24 percent in 2012, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Data from the Inter-American Dialogue and Boston University show lending from Chinese state-run banks to countries in the region exceeded $20 billion in 2015 and 2016. Since 2005, those loans have exceeded combined financing to the region from the IDB, World Bank and CAF, a Latin American development bank. 
Commercial banks like ICBC are becoming increasingly active, Myers said, and the Asian American Infrastructure Bank (AIIB) - a 2-year-old Beijing-based multilateral lender - is seeking to partner with the IDB on projects in the region, such as roads, railways, ports or tunnels that could improve connectivity with Asia. 
Seven Latin American countries including Argentina have been approved to join the AIIB, although none have yet paid in to become full members.

5596,'Staten Island Hustle' star: This one trick can help you network like a pro,"Adolfo LaCola's ability to hustle has gotten him far in life: Though he started from humble beginnings, the son of Italian immigrants growing up on Staten Island, New York, he worked his way to the upper echelons of the music industry , becoming the co-owner of Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah's record label.
Today, he's an entrepreneur, investor and star of CNBC's "" Staten Island Hustle ."" On the show, LaCola helps devise new business ideas and schemes with his fellow cast members — Dom Detore, Mike Palmer, Tony DeCicco and Ron Montana — to make extra money.
During his career, there has been one crucial skill that's helped him succeed, LaCola tells CNBC Make It : networking.
""My best advice that I can give anybody is to definitely network anywhere you are,"" LaCola says. ""Always keep in mind who works where [and] what they can do.""
show chapters How these five guys from Staten Island hustled and landed their own TV show 12:57 PM ET Wed, 4 April 2018 | 01:47 While many people network via social media, on LinkedIn or through mentorship, LaCola insists there's really just one old-school trick you need to make meaningful connections.
""The biggest trick to networking is memory,"" LaCola explains. ""Anyone you get introduced to, always remember that person, because 10 years from now you may need to call that person.""
It's worked for LaCola throughout his life. It's how he became involved with Wu-Tang clan.
""Staten Island is a small borough. So a group that makes it as big as Wu-Tang did on Staten Island, everyone tends to know it,"" says LaCola, who used to DJ in local clubs. ""I kind of had a reputation of my own [in music], and running into Ghostface or Method Man every now and then, we ended up becoming friends.""
Recently, when LaCola and his investing partners were launching New York WaterMaker , a machine promoted as transforming any water into New York water for perfect bagels and pizza, the ""Staten Island Hustle"" cast turned to people they knew.
""If you have a guy that works in a pizzeria, he tends to know 15 guys in other pizzerias and that's how you'll sell your first and 15th WaterMaker,"" LaCola explains.
And to keep your connections solid, keep in touch — even when you don't need to.
""Touch base with people every now and then,"" he explains. ""It doesn't have to be like a best friend, but you do call them once or twice a year just to keep your contacts fresh.""
""The best way to work it is to touch base with people so that you're not just calling them when you need something,"" LaCola continues.
""Always maintain a very loose friendship with anybody you meet in life.""

4341,Bitcoin can create some sticky tax situations—here's what experts say investors should do,"In the ever-developing cryptocurrency world, everything from "" bitcoin mining"" to ""airdrops"" could add to the tax bill. 
""What surprised me was the number of people that I've spoken with that didn't necessarily believe that many of these trades were subject to tax,"" said Michael Meisler, global blockchain leader for Ernst & Young's tax practice. ""There was a lack of understanding of some relatively basic tax principles. Calculate your relative gain and pay tax on it.""
The Internal Revenue Service views bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property, which means profits from any transactions are generally subject to capital gains tax. 
Paying the dues on bitcoin itself may be relatively straightforward, unless an investor bought and sold at several different price points. Then that raises question of what the capital gains were. Similar uncertainty exists for a range of other cryptocurrency-related transactions. 
Meisler said he was asked in late 2016 to take on his current role after working with cryptocurrency tax issues for the last six or seven years. He said he was initially supposed to spend 10 percent to 15 percent of his time on cryptocurrency. But it's since taken up more of his time. ""This has been a global issue for us,"" he said.
Airdrops One key area of confusion is how to handle ""airdrops"" and ""hard forks,"" which both distribute new cryptocurrencies to existing investors. For example, bitcoin holders on August 1 technically received an equivalent amount of its offshoot bitcoin cash , which jumped above $750 in two days.
""That's an open question, determining what the value of what that new cryptocurrency is,"" said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute. However, ""it's probably income more similar to a dividend.""
The American Bar Association's Section of Taxation sent a letter to the IRS on March 19 and recommended the new coin's value at the time of the ""fork"" should be zero. Capital gains tax would then apply to subsequent gains. The IRS did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Regardless, ""if you received coins in an airdrop last year, particularly if you claimed them, you need to report something on your tax return,"" said Elizabeth Crouse, a Seattle-based partner at law firm K&L Gates who contributed to the bar association's letter.
However, in the fast-changing world of cryptocurrencies, airdrops may not be a major issue for taxpayers in future years. Critics have said the method of free coin distribution is not as effective as developers may have hoped in promoting new cryptocurrencies.
""I personally have a lot of conversations about airdrops,"" Ernst & Young's Meisler said.
""In the absence of guidance it's not clear how it should be treated,"" he said. ""Some have taken a view of we're going to monitor this for a little bit and see if this is worth paying because there've been quite a number of airdrops and most of them don't amount to anything.""
Bitcoin mining The IRS is clearer in the event a taxpayer has created bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies through the ""mining"" process. Mining typically requires specialized hardware and uses high computing power to solve a complex mathematical equation in order to receive bitcoin as a reward.
""The net earnings from self-employment resulting from those activities constitute self-employment income and are subject to self-employment tax,"" the IRS said in a March 2014 notice. 
Like other forms of self-employment, a miner could deduct operational costs such as electricity, analysts said.
Online purchases using cryptocurrency Since the IRS treats bitcoin as property, online transactions using the cryptocurrency are subject to capital gains tax. 
""It's similar to bartering,"" The Tax Institute's Rigney said. ""Actually it can be a headache for both sides, but the buyer has to pay the tax because they sold their cryptocurrency"" in order to purchase the product online.""
Rigney also noted that retailers typically use a third party settlement company to convert customers' cryptocurrency into cash.
Tax reporting challenges Bitcoin multiplied more than 13 times last year, and the entire cryptocurrency market gained well over $500 billion in paper value. As a result, U.S. households likely owe $25 billion in capital gains taxes for their digital currency holdings, according to estimates from Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.
However, properly reporting those taxes ""right now it's certainly more significantly challenging than stocks or securities because the infrastructure's not there,"" said Jim Calvin, partner at Deloitte. ""The accounting for transactions, the support is not there.""
For example, when calculating the ""costs of goods sold,"" companies can adopt a standard of ""last in, first out,"" or ""first in, first out"" that determines the price of inventory sold based on date. But no standard for cryptocurrency trades yet exists.
Calvin expects the problem will be resolved in the next year or so through better cryptocurrency accounting software.
But as the April 17 deadline for this tax season rapidly approaches, few Americans appear to be paying their cryptocurrency-related taxes.
Of the 250,000 most recent filers on the Credit Karma Tax platform, fewer than 100 people reported capital gains on their cryptocurrency investments, data released Friday showed. And in January, Credit Karma and research company Qualtrics found just over half, or 52 percent, of 2,004 Americans were unsure how their cryptocurrency holdings would affect their taxes.
Fifty-seven percent of respondents did say they've realized gains from those investments, but 59 percent said they've never reported any cryptocurrency gains to the IRS. 
""The one thing to remember is how you use it is how it's taxed,"" Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant at TurboTax, said in a phone interview.
""People think that even if they're holding onto bitcoin they may have to do something,"" she said. But ""it's not a taxable event.""",2018-04-13T23:05:00.000+03:00
3175,Walmart to expand grocery delivery business to 800 stores by year's end,"Walmart plans to expand its online grocery delivery service to a fleet of roughly 800 stores by the end of the year, as competition continues to ramp up in the digital grocery aisle.
The expansion will open up the retailer to 100 metropolitan areas, reaching more than 40 percent of U.S. households. It will offer shoppers same-day delivery of fresh produce, meat and seafood, along with non-perishable items.
Walmart's grocery delivery business will be supported by a number of partners, including Uber, the company said on Wednesday. It has already been working with Uber as it has piloted its efforts.
The announcement comes just weeks after Amazon added two cities to its new Amazon Prime grocery delivery service, bringing the total number up to six. Other retailers such as Kroger and Target have been partnering with third-party providers such as Instacart, Deliv and Shipt.
Walmart has been preparing its stores for its online grocery business, re-outfitting many of them to support the service, CNBC previously reported. Those stores will be the first to introduce the program, Tom Ward, the vice president of Walmart's digital operations in the U.S., said on a call with members of the media.
It expects to make online order pickup of groceries available at about 2,200 stores before 2019.
""We will ... reach as many households as we can,"" Ward said. ""We will leverage our footprint where it makes the most sense.""
To order groceries online from Walmart.com and have them delivered, a shopper will pay a flat delivery fee of $9.95, and a basket must contain at least $30 worth of items. Orders can also be placed via a Walmart Grocery app. There is no subscription required, as is the case for Amazon Fresh and a handful of other, more costly options on the market.
For packing the items together in stores, Walmart will use its collection of more than 18,000 ""personal shoppers."" Ward said more workers are moving into that position on a weekly basis, as more Walmart stores are outfitted to fulfill orders via its website.
""We are gaining new customers who might not have had access to Walmart previously,"" Ward said about what he's learned from the pilot test of grocery delivery thus far. The service was being offered in Dallas, San Jose, Denver, Phoenix, Tampa and Orlando.
For shoppers who are new to the program when it rolls out later this year, Walmart is offering $10 off a first order of $50 or more, and free delivery if a basket also meets that threshold.",2018-03-14T06:01:00.000+02:00
784,Health insurer Aetna's quarterly profit soars 75.5% on lower costs,"Aetna , which has agreed to be bought by CVS Health , reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, partly due to higher premium yields in the health insurer's commercial and government businesses.
U.S. drugstore operator CVS agreed in December to acquire Aetna for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies.
The CVS-Aetna deal will combine one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans.
Aetna, which expects the deal with CVS to close in the second half of 2018, said the U.S. tax reform will increase gross 2018 adjusted earnings by about $800 million.
Net income attributable to Aetna rose to $244 million, or 74 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $139 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.25 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.20, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue fell nearly 6 percent to $14.85 billion, but inched ahead of analysts' estimate of $14.83 billion.",2018-01-30T13:46:00.000+02:00
4057,Saudi Aramco could skip the red tape and list its IPO at home,"Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco could first issue stock on its home market and privately place shares in the hands of big Asian investors before facing the complexity of listing on an international exchange.
That is one idea under consideration for what could be the world's largest public offering. Starting the process in Saudi Arabia could simplify Aramco's recapitalization, which is a centerpiece of the kingdom's goal to diversity away from oil under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan.
The Saudi government hopes to raise $100 billion from a sale of 5 percent of Aramco, but the valuation is still uncertain. Also uncertain is the timing of an offering, which appears to be drifting into 2019 from an earlier goal of 2018. Aramco officials continue to say the IPO process is on ""track.""
""A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track,"" said a Saudi Aramco official.
Aramco has said it is ready to go forward with the IPO but awaits the go ahead from the government. Officials have also said the local exchange Tadawul would be the anchor market.
One factor favoring the idea of first listing locally is the anticipated award in June of emerging market status for Saudi Arabia by index firm MSCI. That designation could bring a wave of foreign capital into the local market next year as global fund managers add Saudi Arabia to their holdings.
""It makes sense for them to list on the Saudi stock exchange, even if this is the first listing that we have,"" said John Sfakianikis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center.
A local stock sale would get around stricter disclosures required by bigger foreign exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange or London Stock Exchange. But both of them, as well as Hong Kong, would provide far more liquidity than Tadawul.
Reuters reported that there's a 50 percent chance Saudi Aramco could list locally and skip an international IPO altogether. But a source close to the IPO said the company's goal is to issue stock both at home and abroad.
""They are absolutely intent on doing this internationally,"" the source said. The international listing is believed to be important to the crown prince, who is heir apparent of his 82-year-old father King Salman.
The 32-year-old crown prince is expected to visit the U.S. next week, and President Donald Trump has made it clear he would like to see the international listing in New York. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has said it would be a risk to list in New York because of liabilities and litigation, including the climate change lawsuits against other oil companies by New York City.
According to the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange is still in the running but not until 2019 at this point.
Peter Donisanu, Wells Fargo global market strategist, said the size of the whole Aramco listing on the local exchange could be problematic. But Aramco could also just float part of the stock there.
""You float out that much into a $450 billion market, it's going to make up a quarter to the market cap, so movements of that company would affect that market as a whole. That's one consideration for MSCI when they're thinking of moving Saudi Arabia away from a non-affiliated market in the emerging market basket,"" said Donisanu. ""MSCI doesn't make these considerations in isolation. It makes them in consultation with big money managers.""",2018-03-13T21:41:00.000+02:00

2537,"As Puerto Rico pushes forward with new fiscal plan, Tesla and others propose energy fixes","It's been nearly five months since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and yet more than 20 percent of the island is still without power, hundreds of thousands of residents have left for the mainland and the bankrupt U.S. territory doesn't have a fiscal plan in place to help it emerge from financial distress.
However, the governor of Puerto Rico said Thursday the commonwealth is just weeks away from disclosing its 2015 audited financial statements and a few days away from getting its proposed fiscal plan certified. Gov. Ricardo Rossello also said he has received 19 proposals from companies, including Tesla and Sonnen, for energy projects to transform the antiquated energy grid that was decimated by the storm.
Rossello, who was delivering the keynote at the Financial Times' ""Puerto Rico: Pathway to the Future"" forum on Thursday, said he planned to meet with the Oversight Board later in the day to finalize the commonwealth's revised fiscal plan he submitted on Monday.
In an interview with CNBC, Rossello said he hopes to have it certified in the ""next couple of days.""
""This fiscal plan is much different than the first one,"" Rossello said. ""It's not driven by austerity measures. It's driven by structural changes and structural reforms.""
The proposal for the revised fiscal plan, which includes the injection of nearly $17 billion of federal funds from the U.S. government's bipartisan budget bill, covers a six-year period and projects a budget surplus, which could open the door to resuming debt service payments in coming years.
Due to the federal funds, the commonwealth estimates it could pay approximately $19.1 billion to creditors, over a 30-year term, at a 4.5 percent interest rate. The prior draft of the revised plan allotted nothing for the island's bondholders over the next five years.
While the price of many of the island's bonds rallied on the new proposal, several creditor groups that collectively own what they describe as a ""substantial portion of Puerto Rico's outstanding debt,"" united together to ask the Oversight Board to reconsider the ""flawed plan.""
In their opinion, it fails to meet the key principles of the 2016 law that set forth the terms for restructuring the island's debt: ""Achieve fiscal responsibility and restore access to capital markets.""
""The Plan fails to provide a credible basis on which to restructure the island's debt, while completely lacking a foundation for revitalizing the local economy and restoring access to the capital markets,"" the creditors said in a statement Wednesday.
The creditors include two bondholder groups that are currently battling in court over who has the first right to Puerto Rico's revenue. The insurers MBIA, Assured Guaranty and Ambac are also among those who are against the proposed fiscal plan.
Despite the backlash from bondholders, Rossello said there is a plan for Puerto Rico to regain access to capital markets. However, certain milestones need to be met first, starting with getting a financial plan certified and then ""tackling the Title III component."" Title III is a process, similar to Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings, that is allowing the island to restructure its debt.
""I think once there is clarity in the process and once some of these milestones are met, then we can see the path forward as to when and where we can get access to the markets,"" Rossello said.
Audited Financials Rossello also addressed the long overdue 2015 audited financial statements. He said the issue dates to the previous administration and called it ""one of his greatest frustrations.""
However, Rossello said he believes the island's audited finances should be completed soon.
""There are still one or two components that are still in the process of being isolated,"" Rossello said. ""I would say that within the next few weeks that should be done and we can start seeing, finally, the first audited financial statement.""
Rossello also said that since they have identified and isolated the problems, he is confident that once the 2015 statement is released they will be able to get the audited financial statements for the more recent fiscal years completed ""soon thereafter.""
Energy Proposals At the end of January, Rossello announced plans to privatize the island's troubled power utility, Prepa, in a 18-month process involving public and private investments.
""We want to transition into a utility 2-point-0 that's customer centric, that can become an economic driver, that's sustainable, and that has a shift from expensive oil, to more of a renewable or cleaner mechanism,"" Rossello said.
Prepa is the sole electricity provider for Puerto Rico with a generation system that is 28 years older than the average power system of its peers located on the mainland U.S.
Complicating matters, the beleaguered utility has approximately $9 billion in outstanding debt and entered into bankruptcy-like proceedings in July. Shortly, thereafter, Hurricane Maria pummeled the island, wiping out almost all of the the customers' electricity.
Rossello said about 80 percent of Prepa customers' electricity has since been restored.
Still, there appears to be corporate interest in upgrading the island's power system. According to Rossello, 19 companies have submitted unsolicited proposals for energy projects, including Tesla, Puma and Sonnen.
Tesla has not responded to CNBC's request for comment.
In a statement, Sonnen said the company ""has not submitted any proposals related to the PREPA privatization process, however we have been in contact with the local government since hurricane María regarding plans for the long-term resiliency of Puerto Rico's energy grid and the potential to utilize Sonnen's experience and expertise from Germany to incorporate an island-wide virtual power plant into the future or Puerto Rico's grid.""
Since the storm, renewable energy companies have been installing microgrids, which are a self-contained system that consists of a combination of solar panels, battery storage and electrical inverters, throughout the island as they operate apart from the Puerto Rico's antiquated main electrical grid.
Sonnen has commissioned 10 microgrids since the hurricane, with the most recent installation taking place on Thursday at S.U. Matrullas, a kindergarten through ninth grade school in the remote town of Orocovis.
The school, which has over 150 students, has been without power since Maria. With the installation of the microgrid, the school does not plan to reconnect with Prepa's power grid, even once power is restored to the area.
Sonnen started installing the microgrids ""immediately after [the company] re-established contact with the island and found the ideal locations,"" Sonnen's Adam Gentner said in a statement Thursday.
""The goal was to provide community power around the island in communities hit hardest by the hurricane as a humanitarian effort,"" Gentner said.
""These microgrids effectively form the blueprint for more than just recovery, but for preparation for islands and regions around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and power outages,"" Sonnen said in the statement.
Correction: An earlier version misstated how many microgrids Sonnen has commissioned since Hurricane Maria. Sonnen has commissioned 10.",2018-02-16T00:35:00.000+02:00
154,Conservative pundit Bill Kristol explains how Sarah Palin helped pave Trump's path to the White House,"CNBC's John Harwood recently sat down with conservative pundit Bill Kristol to discuss a wide range of topics, including the proper role of government , the state of conservative media, how businesses ""sucking up"" to President Donald Trump are creeping him out, and, here, the rise and fall of one-time vice president candidate Sarah Palin .
What follows is an edited excerpt of their conversation:
RJ Sangosti | The Denver Post | Getty Images Sarah Palin Harwood: There are people who trace a direct line from Sarah Palin to Donald Trump . It is characterized as ""the dumbing down of Republican politics,"" an anti-intellectual movement, which is odd from you because you are an intellectual.
Kristol: Yeah, she turned out to be a disappointment. I mean, when she was picked, she was a popular governor of Alaska who had taken on the oil companies and so forth. I thought Palin as [John] McCain's VP would be a way to almost channel a certain kind of populism into what I would say is a healthy conservatism.
Harwood: You discovered her on a Weekly Standard cruise, right?
Kristol: She invited Fred Barnes and me and our families over to lunch at the governor's residence there. And we were impressed by her. And she was charming. And she was different — 42-year-old governor of Alaska, kind of an exotic state.
I had been originally for John McCain picking Joe Lieberman — a centrist play against Barack Obama. And they chose not to go that way. And then I thought, 'OK, well, why not take the gamble with Palin?'
But I will say this. For all the alleged dumbing down, the people who ran and won in 2010 and 2012 were pretty impressive, a lot of them. The Republican ticket in 2012 was Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Whatever again you think of them, that's not a dumbed-down ticket.
So I thought, 'OK, Palin, they didn't win.' And I thought, 'OK, she chose to be a celebrity rather than a politician.' I didn't realize that we were going into a celebrity culture — such a celebrity culture that Trump would actually as a celebrity run and win in 2016.
I don't think Palin really led to Trump. Was this somehow a bit of a precursor or something? I'm willing to say, 'Maybe so.'

* Bayer: remedies offered previously helped win China nod 
* Bayer: pledged to grant fair access to digital platform 
* Approvals still outstanding in some jurisdictions (Adds Bayer statement, remedies offered, progress in other jurisdictions) 
BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - Bayer's on Tuesday 
secured conditional approval from China's commerce ministry 
for its planned acquisition of the world No. 1 seed company Monsanto, chalking up a victory in the onerous struggle to win over watchdogs across the globe. 
The ministry also ordered the German drug and crop chemicals maker to spin off some businesses globally, including vegetable seeds, corn, soybean, cotton, and herbicide, according to a statement posted on the ministry's website. 
Bayer has already pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.27 billion) to BASF to address EU regulatory concerns and has separately offered to sell its vegetable seeds business to BASF. 
""These divestments are covered by our agreement and the ongoing negotiations with BASF as previously communicated,"" Bayer said in a statement. 
In addition, Bayer committed to grant ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access"" to the merged entity's digital agriculture offerings in China to Chinese developers of farm management software. 
Bayer has secured the go-ahead from Brazilian regulators, while people familiar with the matter told Reuters two weeks ago that Bayer was in the frame to win conditional antitrust approval from the European Union for the $62.5 billion deal. 
Bayer said at the time that the U.S. review was not as far advanced as EU's, but it was confident it would make progress there over the next few weeks. 
In Russia, however, Bayer has taken the regulator to court to ""safeguard its rights"" in the review procedure. ($1 = 0.8114 euros) (Reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk, Patricia Weiss and Ludwig Burger Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Pritha Sarkar)",2018-03-13T15:56:00.000+02:00

2901,House Speaker Ryan: Special counsel Mueller 'should be free' to follow through with Russia probe,"House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday that the special counsel ""should be free"" to complete his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.
""The special counsel should be free to follow through his investigation to conclusion,"" Ryan said at a news conference Tuesday morning. The Wisconsin Republican also said he has received assurances that Trump won't fire Robert Mueller . ""We have a system based on rule of law,"" the speaker added.
Ryan's statement comes as Republicans face criticism for not taking a hard stance against the possibility that could fire the special counsel. The speaker's remarks largely line up with other GOP lawmakers' statements on Mueller.
Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, has said he doesn't see a need to use legislation to protect Mueller. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said that firing Mueller would mark the ""beginning of the end"" of Trump's presidency, although he has also said that he has no concerns about a potential termination.
Trump and one of his lawyers , John Dowd, reignited concerns that the president might fire the special counsel over the weekend , after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe two days before his retirement. Trump often targeted McCabe in harsh tweets, and lumped in his firing with the Mueller investigation. The president also blasted former FBI Director James Comey in his weekend tweet storm. Trump fired Comey in May.
Sunday night, another Trump lawyer, Ty Cobb, followed up by saying that the president wasn't thinking or talking about firing the special counsel.
Yet on Monday, Trump again spurred speculation that he could terminate Mueller , tweeting, ""A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!"" The president has often referred to the investigation as a ""witch hunt."" On Tuesday, Trump declined to answer when a reporter asked whether he wanted Mueller fired.
Trump has repeatedly denied colluding with the Russians.
The legal team representing the president in the Russia probe is also in upheaval, according to various media reports. Dowd told CNBC on Tuesday, however, that the team remains intact.

4721,Potemkin summit: How the 'historic' Korean meeting fell short,"If you stayed up late, like me, to watch the big summit between North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and South Korea President Moon Jae-in you likely wasted, like me, what could have been a good night's sleep or a fun night on the town.
I fear, at least for the moment, history will judge this meeting as nothing more than a Potemkin summit—filled with countless photos designed to pull at your heart, when in fact, zero was achieved.
The optics could not have been any better, having almost a cinematic feel to it all. But the only movie that was emulated here was the geopolitical equivalent of Bill Murray's Groundhog Day. North Korea , once again, made promise after promise while gaining more and more time to build evermore advanced nuclear weapons and missiles to mount them on.
There were some meaningful aspects to this summit that are worth noting.
First, the moment when Kim and Moon shook hands, with Kim crossing over to South Korea , was truly historic. Then, Kim offered, and Moon accepted, the North Korean dictator's invitation to cross over briefly to the North Korean side to shake hands and take photos, also truly historic.
Next, the sheer amount of potential—and that is the key word, potential—promises made was certainly eye opening. Both sides will work hard to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, a promise only Kim Jong Un can truly fulfill.
And both nations also agreed to push forward, bringing in other nations like the U.S. and China, to sign an agreement to formally end the Korean War—a cold war vestige that certainly needs to discarded in the trash heap of history once and for all.
What happens next This is where things get tricky. All the promises in the world, and a summit deigned to wow the international community, is meaningless unless it is followed up with concrete actions to fulfill its promise. Otherwise, the world's collective time, and hope, has been wasted.
What must happen now is the Trump Administration must push North Korea to turn its lofty promises into action. That means for the even bigger summit to take place between Trump and Kim, North Korea must put pen to paper, sharing with Team Trump how it plans to denuclearize.
For example, the U.S must demand that Kim layout a concrete plan, along with a timeline, of how it will give up its nuclear weapons. That plan should also include an agreement for the full accounting of all of Kim's atomic arms; a listing of all materials he can use to make additional nuclear weapons as well as a detailed accounting of North Korea's various offensive missiles.
But we should also make sure we get from Pyongyang what so far no one has been willing to ask: what does Kim want for his nuclear weapons and missiles?
Indeed, this is the lynch pin of our whole negotiation with North Korea. This is how we will be able to tell if Kim is serious about denuclearizing, or, we will know we have all been played.
Team Trump and South Korea must demand from Kim his own demands for giving up his atomic arsenal. We will then have a sense if we can meet those demand—which could be quite steep.
In fact, in 2010, North Korea asked for $10 billion dollars just to attend a summit with South Korea. One can only imagine his asking price to give up the only weapon of war that could stop a future U.S. or allied effort at deposing his regime. Before we go any further with Pyongyang, we need to know what Kim really is after.
If we can ascertain firm answers, and Kim is truly willing to give up his nuclear weapons and submit to inspections, and we can meet his demands, then we have every reason for President Trump and Kim to meet. If not, and North Korea continues to demand extended talks that could go on for months or years, we know Kim is truly recycling the family playbook. And Trump needs to walk away.

Noting that the most recent federal data showed that U.S. crude production broke 10 million barrels per day in November for the first time since 1970, Streible pointed to crude's significant long position among speculators.

""You've got the net speculative long positions at its highest level since 2006; I think it's got nowhere to go from here but down,"" he said.
Crude prices have surged 9 percent this year, making January the fifth-straight month of gains. The rally has boosted energy stocks: The XLE energy ETF has rallied nearly 5 percent in January.

The group appears overbought at this juncture, said Matt Maley, equity strategist with Miller Tabak.

""That $78 level … that's key resistance. That's its high from 2016, and its high from last week. If, on its next rally, it can break above that level in any significant way, that's going to be very bullish for the group,"" Maley said Thursday on ""Trading Nation.""

1895,"Rising inflation is not enough to rattle Wall Street, says Bessemer Trust's Rebecca Patterson","Inflation fears may be sparking nearly daily swings in the market, but Bessemer Trust's Rebecca Patterson doesn't see it as a reason to get bearish on stocks.
Patterson, the firm's chief investment officer, doesn't see the jitters rattling Wall Street.
""You can have rising yields and rising equity values,"" the CNBC contributor said Wednesday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation .""
Besides fundamentals supporting growth, Patterson believes this month's correction flushed out much of the investor euphoria in the market. She considers herself ""constructive"" on stocks.
""A drawdown of 10 percent or 11 percent in equities — that's typical for a given year even when equities end up,"" she said. ""We now have, I believe, three [Fed interest rate] hikes discounted in market valuations for the rest of this year. And the equity market, so far, doesn't seem to mind.""
Her caveats: Rises in Treasury-bond yields must be gradual, and the economy must be strong enough to sustain them.
""The worry would be if we had more signs of economic weakness at the same time we have inflation. That's a scary stagflationary environment,"" Patterson said. ""Higher yields then go with lower equities. I don't think we're getting that.""
Fears about inflation heightened after recent government data showed a strong gain in consumer prices and the biggest jump in wages since the Great Recession . The consumer price index report on Wednesday sent 10-Year Treasury yields within a hair of 3 percent.
Patterson acknowledges conditions are ripe for volatility to continue its comeback after 2017's unusual calmness. On Wednesday, the Dow , S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained more than 1 percent after spending part of the morning in the red — a fluctuation that was rare to see last year.
""I think the Fed is relieved to see at least a little volatility in equities,"" said Patterson. ""The very low volatility environment, [and] the straight line up for stocks frankly made them uneasy. So, today feels more like a normal environment.""

5442,The first drone warship just joined the Navy and now nearly every element of it is classified,"The first warship to traverse open waters without a single crew member recently joined the U.S. Navy's fleet after eight years of development and testing.
And now nearly every element of the vehicle, known as the Sea Hunter, has become classified.
""About all I can tell you is that it has transitioned from [the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] to the Navy, and that's a success in the world of science and technology,"" said Rear Adm. Nevin Carr. ""And that's a good thing, because that means that there's a there there.""
Carr talked to CNBC about the vessel's status shift during the Sea-Air-Space conference, the largest maritime expo in the United States. He is uniquely familiar with Sea Hunter since he oversaw its testing as chief of the Office of Naval Research and its current development as Leidos vice president and Navy strategic account executive.
Leidos is the sole defense contractor helping to engineer the vessel.
The product of 'mad science' The concept for the unmanned vessel was born in 2010 out of the Pentagon's so-called mad science wing, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
The Pentagon's request from DARPA was colossal: Develop a drone warship capable of hunting submarines, detecting torpedoes and avoiding objects at sea while traveling at a top speed of 27 knots, or 31 mph.
Six years later, the crewless, 140-ton, 132-foot-long robotic ship, was christened as Sea Hunter on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon.
""The project is classic DARPA, not only game-changing but paradigm-bending,"" Paul Scharre writes in ""Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War.""
""Sleek and angular, it looks like something time-warped in from the future,"" adds Scharre, a former U.S. Army Ranger and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. ""With a long narrow hull and two outriggers, the Sea Hunter carves the oceans like a three-pointed dagger, tracking enemy submarines.""
On hand for the ship's 2016 christening was then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, who referred to the vessel's narrow bow as a ""Klingon Bird of Prey"" from the ""Star Trek"" series.
""This will operate wherever the United States Navy operates,"" Work told reporters after the ceremony. ""It can operate in the South China Sea. It can operate in the Baltic Sea. It can operate in the Persian Gulf. And it can operate in the middle of the Atlantic or the middle of the Pacific.""
""These will be everywhere,"" he added.
After its unveiling in 2016, Sea Hunter was transferred to the Navy for nearly two years of testing off the coast of California. Since the drone ships' inception, the Navy and Leidos have been hesitant to provide updates on its future role.
A fraction of the cost of a destroyer show chapters This autonomous warship can spend months at sea without a crew 5:27 PM ET Fri, 16 Feb 2018 | 01:02 Secretary Work also noted the financial value of adding Sea Hunter to the Navy's fleet.
Sea Hunter's $20 million price tag is a fraction of the cost compared with a new Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which would require approximately $1.6 billion in defense funds.
The drone ship also has an estimated operating cost ranging from $15,000 to $20,000 a day whereas a destroyer costs $700,000 a day to operate.
Carr notes, however, that Sea Hunter was not designed to replace naval vessels but collaborate with them.
""People see something like Sea Hunter and they think you want to replace my ship, and it's not that at all,"" Carr said. ""An autonomous thing does not replace a manned thing it augments. It's not a one for one replacement.""
Last year, Leidos, was awarded a $35.5 million Navy contract to build the second unmanned vessel dubbed Sea Hunter II.
And while another drone ship is on the way, it remains to be seen what missions the Navy has envisioned for Sea Hunter and its sister.
""The original model was that this would be an automatic submarine hunter,"" Carr said. ""What we learned along the way is that the real power wasn't in any particular mission, it was having an autonomous pickup truck that could go away for long periods of time and have a persistent capability for whatever mission the Navy wants to do.""
Sea Hunter is currently not equipped with weapons, but Work, the former deputy Defense secretary, described a scenario in which one day it could be armed.
""We might be able to put a six pack or a four pack of missiles on them. Now imagine 50 of these distributed and operating together under the hands of a flotilla commander,"" Work said. ""This is going to be a Navy unlike any navy in history, a human-machine collaborative battle fleet that will confound our enemies.""",2018-04-25T21:30:00.000+03:00
569,EXCLUSIVE-Boeing willing to keep Brazil's 'golden share' in Embraer deal,"EXCLUSIVE-Boeing willing to keep Brazil's 'golden share' in Embraer deal Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle Published 11 Hours Ago Reuters SHARES 
BRASILIA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is working to overcome the Brazilian military's objections to its proposed tie-up with Embraer SA with alternatives that would preserve the government's strategic veto rights and ensure safeguards for its defense programs, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The U.S. planemaker was forced back to the drawing board after Brazilian officials balked last week at the idea of turning Embraer into a subsidiary such as those that Boeing operates in Australia and Britain, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the negotiations freely. 
""Boeing came to buy Embraer, not for a partnership or a joint venture that we are open to, but to take control of the company. This was rejected,"" one of the sources, a government official, said. ""It is up to Boeing to come back with a new proposal."" 
Boeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's Bombardier Inc and run by European rival Airbus SE since last year. 
Since the news broke last month that it was in talks with Boeing, Embraer's shares are up 22 percent in New York, where 51 percent of its stock is listed, bringing its market capitalization to $4.6 billion. 
Boeing's proposal would value the company at $5 billion to $6 billion, a person familiar with the negotiations said. 
Yet Boeing's plan has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems. 
The Brazilian government holds a 'golden share' in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest. 
Boeing would be willing to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer, the people familiar with the matter said, but that may not be enough to win support. 
Embraer said it would not comment on the matter and representatives for Boeing and the Defense Ministry, which is coordinating talks with the government, did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
AIR FORCE RESISTANCE 
Officials at the Finance Ministry and development bank BNDES, which owns 5 percent of the planemaker, have been supportive of the deal, but military officials are far more skeptical, according to the sources. The BNDES declined comment and the ministry did not reply. 
""The Air Force is the main source of resistance, said an aide to President Michel Temer. ""The military oppose any split up of Embraer."" He said Jungmann has yet to make a recommendation on a Boeing deal to the president. 
In an emailed comment, the Air Force said it ""considers Embraer a strategic company that is fundamental for our national sovereignty, so a possible partnership with Boeing should be studied from this point of view"". 
Air Force commander Lt Brig Nivaldo Luiz Rossato joined Defense Minister Raul Jungmann last week in Brasilia at a meeting with senior Boeing executives including Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, which failed to sway the Brazilians. 
Embraer's special relationship with Brazil's Air Force dates back to its creation in the 1960s as part of a government push to create a domestic aviation industry. The planemaker was opened to private capital in 1994 and fully privatized in 2006, but it still works closely with the Air Force, which is now financing development of the KC-390 military airlifter. 
Boeing, which struck a joint sales and services agreement on the KC-390, has underscored to officials that a tie-up would help to market Embraer's defense products globally and bolster Brazil's nascent space program, one person said. 
Yet government officials are still steering Boeing toward a more narrow joint venture with Embraer focused on commercial aviation a prospect at which Boeing has turned up its nose, according to two people familiar with the talks. 
Neither the government nor the companies want to entirely split off Embraer's commercial or defense operations, given the integration of their technology and engineering resources, the sources said. 
With a presidential election looming in Brazil this year and airlines delaying orders until the shape of the industry is clear, all sides of the negotiations are eager for a resolution. Yet government officials seem keen on pressing their hand. 
""We think Boeing will end up agreeing to a partnership or a joint venture because they have been weakened by the Airbus-Bombardier deal,"" said the official familiar with the talks. ""They have no other possible partner and need a quick fix.""

6709,Ford will halt all production of its popular F-Series pickup,"show chapters Ford suspends F-150 production due to fire at parts supplier 20 Hours Ago | 03:29 With key components about to run out, Ford is pulling the plug on production of its most profitable and popular model, the F-150, late Wednesday evening.
The move means approximately 4,000 workers at Ford's Dearborn Truck Plant will be temporarily laid off, joining roughly 3,600 workers at Ford's truck plant in Kansas City who were told to stay home earlier this week.
""I think it's safe to say, we're going to see an impact over several days, but beyond that we can't say,"" said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford global operations. ""We will be down through the end of the week.""
Both assembly plants are unable to continue building the F-150 pickup truck because of a lack of critical components supplied by Meridian Lightweight Technologies. An explosion and fire at Meridian's facility in Easton Rapids, Michigan, last Wednesday completely knocked out production of components used in the instrument panel of the F-150.
The components shortage has also prompted Ford to stop production of the F-Series Super Duty pickup at its production plant in Louisville, Kentucky.
In addition, Ford is working with the supplier to ensure it has enough key components to continue production of the Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Ford Explorer SUVs. For now, the automaker says final assembly of those SUVs is not changing.
How much could stopping production of the F-Series hurt Ford and dealers who rely on the popular pickup truck to generate huge sales? That depends on how long the assembly lines are shut down.
Ford admits near-term financial results will be adversely impacted by the loss of F-Series production, but the company reaffirmed its full year earnings guidance of $1.45 to $1.70 a share.
Meanwhile, F-Series sales should not be impacted for a while.
""It takes 76 days for an F-150 to sell, so the company does have a bit of a cushion,"" said Ivan Drury, Edmunds senior manager of industry analysis. ""But when you have a vehicle that comprises a quarter of your company's sales, any production disruption is going to cause some consternation.""
Last month Ford sold 73,104 F-Series pickups, with the overwhelming majority of those being the F-150 according to company sales reports. Meanwhile, the automaker ended April with nearly a quarter million trucks on the ground at dealerships, a high percentage were F-150 models.
That inventory will keep Ford dealers stocked for several weeks, though an extended halt to production could be problematic for the automaker and painful for more than 7,600 workers.",2018-05-10T00:00:00.000+03:00
5854,I spent an 11-hour day with a tax pro during tax season—here’s the most surprising thing I learned,"When I headed to H&R Block in late March to get an inside look into the day of a tax pro during busy season, I worried most of the day would be spent twiddling my thumbs.
It's not that I expected the office to be slow, but I thought the day would mostly consist of number-crunching and screen time.
It turns out, preparing taxes is a lot more social than I ever could have imagined. As I learned from tax pro Kwame Matthews, ""50 percent of the job is people skills."" The second half of being a good tax pro boils down to experience and expertise, he told me.
Matthews would know. He's been preparing tax returns for five years and estimates he's seen more than 500 clients at this point. He also manages two H&R Block offices, which means leading two different teams of 20 to 25 tax pros.
CNBC Make It Tax professional Kwame Matthews The client meetings themselves were very social. As Matthews prepared the taxes, he and his clients chatted like longtime friends, about everything from the DMV and grandchildren to politics. After seeing the way he interacts with them, it's no surprise that many are repeat clients from previous years or referrals. People simply like to be around him.
The meetings were draining for me. I'm used to sitting in front of a computer and writing all day, with 15 to 30 minutes interviews sprinkled throughout the afternoon. Matthews, on the other hand, spends much of his day either interacting with clients or his own team of employees. And he has to be on — energetic and enthusiastic — no matter how exhausted or hungry he is.
Matthews had four client meetings that day, three of which I was able to observe. It was the final meeting, which also happened to be the longest, that I couldn't sit in on. While Matthews spent two hours working with his final client of the day, a seven-figure earner, I used the break to pop Advil and hydrate.
CNBC Make It It was a long day Beyond the client meetings, Matthews is responsible for training and managing his employees and making customer service phone calls to clients who weren't happy with their in-office experience, both of which require soft skills.
Another big misconception about his job is that preparing taxes ""isn't all math,"" he told me. ""You don't have to be a math major to be a tax pro."" Sure, you need to understand basic arithmetic and be detail-oriented, but your success in the profession more so boils down to your ability to ""read and comprehend,"" he says. ""And you have to have people skills.""

1816,"In their 2018 annual letter, Bill and Melinda Gates share the secret to their optimism","Last year, Bill and Melinda Gates celebrated their close friend Warren Buffett's optimism in their foundation's annual letter . In their 10th annual letter released Tuesday, the billionaire couple revealed the secret to how they stay optimistic.
""Being an optimist isn't about knowing that life used to be worse. It's about knowing how life can get better. And that's what really fuels our optimism,"" they wrote. 

Called the ""The 10 toughest questions we get,"" the letter starts by pointing out that ""optimism seems to be in short supply"" these days.

""The headlines are filled with awful news,"" they wrote. ""Every day brings a different story of political division, violence or natural disaster.""
Nonetheless, the couple says they ""see a world that's getting better.""
Through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's research and initiatives to help countries facing challenges in education, poverty, hunger and health, the couple has worked at advancing equality around the world.
""Although we see a lot of disease and poverty in our work — and many other big problems that need to be solved — we also see the best of humanity,"" they wrote.
In a roughly two-minute-long video titled ""The evidence for optimism,"" Melinda Gates reviewed data that showed how the world saw a drop in child mortality from 11 million deaths to five million deaths in the course of 16 years.
""To know that the world, in that span of time from 1990 to 2016, can cut childhood deaths in half makes me incredibly optimistic that we will cut that number in half yet again,"" she said.
They also attributed their optimism to ""learning from scientists who are inventing cutting-edge tools to cure disease,"" speaking with government leaders around the world who ""are being creative about prioritizing the health and well-being of people"" and meeting people ""who are imagining new ways to transform their communities.""
Through the rest of the letter, Bill and Melinda further detail their optimism for global change by answering the following 10 ""tough questions"" they often get asked:
1. Why don't you give more in the United States? 
2. What do you have to show for the billion you've spent on U.S. education? 
3. Why don't you give money to fight climate change? 
4. Are you imposing your values on other cultures? 
5. Does saving kids' lives lead to overpopulation? 
6. How are president Trump's policies affecting your foundation's work? 
7. Why do you work with corporations? 
8. Is it fair that you have so much influence? 
9. What happens when the two of you disagree? 
10. Why are really giving your money away--what's in it for you? 
In the foundation's 2017 annual letter addressed to Warren Buffett, Melinda Gates wrote that she believes ""optimism is a huge asset.""
""We can always use more of it. But optimism isn't a belief that things will automatically get better; it's a conviction that we can make things better,"" she wrote.
It's this very attribute that the billionaires say they admire about Buffett and apply in their personal and professional lives.
""We're trying to channel your empathy, add your optimism, mix in technology, apply strategy, and work with partners to save more lives,"" Melinda Gates wrote.
They hope people will ""be just as optimistic as we are"" after reading the responses to their 10 tough questions.

127,"Existing home sales sink in December, market housing supply drops to record low","U.S. home sales fell more than expected in December as the supply of houses on the market dropped to a record low, pushing up prices and likely sidelining some first-time buyers.
The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday that existing home sales declined 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units last month amid decreases in all four regions.
November's sales pace was revised down to 5.78 million units, still the highest level since February 2007. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home sales falling 2.2 percent to a 5.70 million-unit rate in December from a previously reported 5.81 million-unit pace in November.
Existing home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, rose 1.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in December. They increased 1.1 percent to 5.51 million units in 2017, the highest level since 2006.
The NAR attributed the sales decline in December, which followed three straight months of gains, to a perennial shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.
The number of previously owned homes on the market tumbled 11.4 percent to 1.48 million units in December, the lowest since January 1999 when the Realtors group started tracking the series. Housing inventory was down 10.3. percent from a year ago. It has declined for 31 straight months on a year-on-year basis.
At December's sales pace, it would take a record low 3.2 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.5 months in November. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
With supply still tight, the median house price increased 5.8 percent from a year ago to $246,800 in December. That was the 70th straight month of year-on-year price gains. House prices increased 5.8 percent in 2017, rising for the sixth straight year.",2018-01-24T17:00:00.000+02:00
3394,"House Speaker Ryan opposes Trump's tariffs, warns of 'unintended consequences'","CNBC.com Joshua Roberts | Reuters Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks to the media after a House Republican conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan said he opposes Trump's newly enacted tariffs , and urged the Trump administration to narrow its approach. 
""I disagree with this action and fear its unintended consequences,"" Paul Ryan said in a statement shortly after Trump signed two executive orders imposing broad steel and aluminum tariffs. 
Ryan said he and those who share his concerns will ""continue to urge the administration to narrow this policy so that it is focused only on those countries and practices that violate trade law."" 
Ryan's statement echoed the position of at least 107 other Republican members of Congress , who signed a letter Wednesday urging Trump to ""reconsider the idea of broad tariffs to avoid unintended negative consequences to the U.S. economy and its workers."" 
Like the letter, which was signed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , Ryan's statement agreed that ""targeted enforcement"" against ""bad trade practices by nations like China"" are preferable to a global tariff on steel and aluminum imports. 
Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz., also came out against the tariffs and said he would introduce legislation intended to nullify the president's move. 
""Trade wars are not won, they are only lost,"" said Flake, a frequent Trump critic who has decided not to pursue reelection. ""Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster."" 
Flake's bill, however, is likely to be seen as a symbolic gesture. 
The tariffs impose penalties of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum. 
""A strong steel and aluminum industry are vital to our national security,"" Trump said before signing the orders. ""You don't have steel, you don't have a country."" 
Trump used a report from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross outlining national security threats as a basis for justifying the tariffs. 
But Ryan disagreed, saying: ""Our economy and our national security are strengthened by fostering free trade with our allies and promoting the rule of law.""

3327,Former England soccer star Michael Owen is invested in celebrity cryptocurrencies,"Once known for his goal-scoring prowess on the soccer pitch as a star for his country and in clubs such as Liverpool and Real Madrid, former England international player Michael Owen is now moving into the world of cryptocurrency.
Speaking with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday, Owen discussed the reasons behind his investment in Singapore-based Global Crypto Offering Exchange (GCOX), which bills itself as ""the world's first celebrity cryptocurrency exchange."" 
""The career of a sportsman is quite short"" and there remains a life to live after retirement, Owen said. Having retired from the world of professional sports at the age of 33, Owen, now 38, has been venturing into the business world since then.
Despite the risks in cryptocurrencies, Owen said he sees the technology as a good platform for celebrities like himself to interact directly with fans.
""The world evolves, and I think sometimes you've got to be brave."" -Michael Owen, former England international football star GCOX hopes to makes money through transaction fees. The startup is raising private investment and will announce the timing of its first ICO in the second quarter, a GCOX spokesman told CNBC.
Celebrities will be able to launch their own tokens via GCOX and sell merchandise and services which will be paid for in tokens. The celebrities will then have the option of swapping the tokens for Bitcoin or Ether before cashing out at the prevailing market rate, the spokesman said.
Beyond the star power of the former soccer player, GCOX has also brought on boxing legend Manny Pacquaio as a ""private investor.""
Ryan Pierse | Getty Images Michael Owen of England during a 2007 match. GCOX says it will allow famous people to create ""personal cryptocurrencies"" and manage their own initial coin offering (ICO). With enough coins on the marketplace, the platform could become ""the world's first authoritative popularity index,"" the company claims.
The crypto platform says that celebrity tokens — which will be purchasable through its own ""Acclaim"" tokens — could be used as a way to purchase ""exclusive goods and services.""
Cryptocurrencies are volatile investments, but Owen said he thinks ""it's always important to associate yourself with what you consider the best teams at the time,"" drawing a parallel to his career as a professional athlete.
""The world evolves, and I think sometimes you've got to be brave,"" he said, mentioning his experience in witnessing how training on the pitch had evolved along with technological changes.
""As I said, when you associate yourself with the best, then I think you can eliminate most of that risk.""",2018-03-21T09:23:00.000+02:00
7345,Mnuchin says having good conversations in China,"Mnuchin says having good conversations in China Published 18 Hours Ago Reuters Jason Lee | Reuters Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin waves to the media as he and the U.S. delegation for trade talks with China, leave a hotel in Beijing, China May 3, 2018.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Friday a trade delegation he is leading in China has been having very good conversations.
He made the comments to reporters as he left his Beijing hotel for the second and likely final day of trade talks in China.
A breakthrough deal to fundamentally change China's economic policies is viewed as highly unlikely during the two days of talks, though a package of short-term Chinese measures could delay Washington's decision to impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese exports.
The discussions, led by Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, are expected to cover a wide range of U.S. complaints about China's trade practices, from accusations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development.
""Thrilled to be here. Thank you,"" Mnuchin told Reuters at his hotel when asked if he expected progress.
As Mnuchin arrived, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!""
It was not clear when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet again next, though both will likely attend some of the same multilateral summits this year, including those of the G-20 and APEC.
Throughout his 2016 election campaign, Trump routinely threatened to impose a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on Chinese goods as a way to level the playing field for American workers. At the time, he was also accusing China of manipulating its currency to gain an export advantage, a claim that his administration has since dropped.
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the U.S. delegation planned to meet Chinese officials on both days, in addition to U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad, before leaving on Friday evening.
The delegation returned to their hotel late on Thursday evening without taking questions from reporters, though, when asked how the talks were going, one unidentified U.S. official said ""Well.""
In Washington, the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies doing business in China, said it was pleased the two governments were talking and urged a deal to end forced technology transfers and improve China's intellectual property protections.
""USCBC believes it is unlikely that the issues will be fully resolved in this meeting, but we hope the two sides will be able to lay out a path for continued negotiations that will lead to a solution and avoid tariffs and other commerce-slowing sanctions,"" the group said in a statement.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a briefing in Beijing: ""The outcome should be mutually beneficial and win-win.""
In a commentary widely cited in Chinese media on Thursday, the official Xinhua news agency said if things went poorly and a trade war did break out, China would never yield and would hit back strongly.
""China will inevitably suffer losses, but China has the political advantage of a centralised and unified leadership and support of a massive domestic market,"" it said.
The official China Daily said in an editorial that China would ""stand up to the U.S.' bullying as necessary.""
""The U.S. wants greater access to China's market, but it should not use trade actions as a battering ram to force China to open its doors. It is already in the process of opening them wider,"" the English-language newspaper said.
In doing so, China expected Washington to reciprocate and open its market to Chinese investment and competition, it said.

6102,UPDATE 1-Brazil homebuilder MRV to boost housing starts after hitting profit estimates,"UPDATE 1-Brazil homebuilder MRV to boost housing starts after hitting profit estimates Gram Slattery Published 7:36 PM ET Mon, 7 May 2018 Reuters
estimates@ (Adds details from interview with co-CEO, including information on housing starts and regulatory issues)
SAO PAULO, May 7 (Reuters) - MRV Engenharia e Participações SA, Latin America's largest homebuilder by units sold, is planning to launch a robust new slate of projects in the coming months after hitting quarterly profit estimates, an executive told Reuters.
In a Monday securities filing, MRV reported first quarter net income of 160 million reais ($45.1 million), up 22 percent from the same period last year and roughly in line with Reuters estimates.
The company also reported healthy margins, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) coming in at 229 million reais, up some 44 percent from the same period a year ago, and slightly above Reuters forecasts.
MRV's improving operational figures, while expected, represent a larger rebound in Brazilian real estate, as delinquencies begin falling, credit opens up, and consumers gain confidence after a years-long recession.
In an interview, MRV co-Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Fischer struck an upbeat tone, saying real estate demand was strengthening and operational numbers at the homebuilder would continue to improve throughout 2018.
""We're very optimistic about the rest of the year,"" he said. ""We're seeing very strong demand for real estate.""
He added that the homebuilder would significantly pick up the pace of new project launches in the second quarter.
MRV had previously set an ambitious goal of launching 50,000 new home units in 2018. However, in previously released numbers, the company reported launching just over 5,000 new units in the first quarter.
Fischer said the first quarter has historically been weak in terms of project launches, and he pledged to maintain the company's original 50,000-unit target.
""In 2018, we'll get there,"" he said.
In the first quarter, some of MRV's more upscale competitors, such as Cyrela Brazil Realty SA and Eztec Empreendimentos e Participações SA, faced bureaucratic headwinds, after a court effectively invalidated many building permits in the key city of Sao Paulo, at least temporarily.
Fischer emphasized that, unlike competitors, none of MRV's projects had been affected by the issue.

2975,"4 behaviors that transform ordinary people into CEOs, according to a study of 2,600 leaders","If you think all CEOs are Ivy League educated individuals who set their eyes on the C-suite at a young age, you're mistaken. According to Elena Botelho and Kim Powell, authors of the book "" The CEO Next Door ,"" ""Even the most impressive CEOs often didn't start out knowing they were destined for greatness.""
However, many of us believe the stereotype that an ""iconic CEO is powerful and patrician, a bold, charismatic extrovert with a flawless resume,"" write the researchers. This makes us falsely assume that we are not ""CEO material."" To the contrary, ordinary people can also become CEOs, note the authors, as long as they have the necessary traits.
To uncover these traits, Botelho and Powell turned to a dataset of 17,000 leadership assessments from the research firm ghSMART. In partnership with professors from the University of Chicago and Columbia University, they selected a subset of 2,600 leaders to further analyze, and found a trend among successful CEOs.
According to their research, four simple behaviors can turn everyday people into powerful CEOs: decisiveness, engaging for impact, relentless reliability and adapting boldly.
1. Make quick decisions According to the data, successful CEOs are decisive and are 12 times more likely to be high performers.
Steve Gorman, the former CEO of Greyhound , exemplifies why this trait is so crucial. When Gorman took over Greyhound in 2003, the business was losing money, according to the study. In addition, its parent company, which had just come out of bankruptcy, was ready to shut the doors on the company.
For four months, Gorman listened to his top execs create and dismiss plans to save the company but eventually he had enough. Among the many piles of data his team analyzed was a satellite map of the U.S. and Canada, which showed where all the nation's lights were concentrated (a reflection of population density). Unsure if his plan would work, he immediately set out to reshape Greyhound bus routes around these heavily populated regions. His strategy worked.
By the time he left Greyhound in 2007, the company reported $30 million earnings and was eventually sold for twice its 2003 value. The authors explain that Gorman was able to ""push forward"" not because he knew his plan would work but because he realized that a potentially bad decision was much better than no decision.
2. Get people to buy into your idea To be a successful CEO, you must engage those around you and inspire them to deliver results, according to the authors. But it's not as simple as being nice or getting people to like you. In fact, nice CEOs can be a drag on an organization because they focus more on being agreeable than getting workers to deliver quality results, say the researchers.
To effectively persuade people to buy into your ideas, the authors say to do three things:
Translate your vision and goals and be clear about your intent. Understand the emotional, financial and physical needs of the people who will help you deliver results. Establish everyday routines and habits to build relationships, which translate into action and eventually business results. Steve Jobs , the late CEO and founder of Apple , created such a successful company because he engaged his employees and galvanized them to come up with innovative products and ideas.
""[Jobs] was in many cases very cruel to people and very unkind,"" Willie Pietersen, a management professor at Columbia Business School and author of ""Strategic Learning: How to Be Smarter Than Your Competition and Turn Key Insights into Competitive Advantage ,"" tells CNBC Make It . ""But people gave him a pass on that because of his absolute brilliance, and the excitement and the exhilaration of working behind a brilliant idea.""
show chapters This entrepreneurship professor has studied over 30,000 business pitches—here's what he's learned      5:36 PM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 | 01:35 3. Deliver consistent results CEOs who consistently deliver results and successfully execute plans are seen as reliable, according to the researchers. Once a CEO is known for their reliability, their odds of getting hired double.
The authors also note that out of all four behaviors, ""relentless reliability"" is the most important for executive success because it also increases the odds of excelling.
""In business, reliable and competent people are cherished,"" write the authors. ""Employers and clients are more apt to take risks on them and more apt to give them opportunities.""
Virgin Group founder Richard Branson did just that when he created Virgin Australia, the country's second largest airline. The decision to launch this airline was actually the brainchild of his employee Brett Godfrey, who Branson immediately took a liking to because he was personable, detail-oriented and hardworking .
""[I] saw how he dealt with people in a personable manner and got the best out of them,"" Branson writes in his latest autobiography, "" Finding my Virginity .""
The billionaire was so impressed by his employee's work ethic that when Godfrey suggested creating an airline company in his home country of Australia, Branson bit. In 2000, Virgin Australia officially entered the aviation market with Godfrey as CEO ( a position he held until 2010 ).
4. Adapt to the circumstances ""To get to the top, aspiring leaders have to learn to navigate the uncharted,"" write the authors. They point to Kodak, Blockbuster and Borders as companies that failed because their leaders didn't adapt.
Their analysis also found that the CEOs who excel at adapting feel comfortable being uncomfortable. These execs understand that discomfort comes with change and learning. Furthermore, adaptable CEOs can let go of the past and focus on the future, much like Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos .
When Amazon.com launched in 1994, the company only sold books. Bezos then expanded to music and videos before asking customers what other products they wanted the company to offer. ""The list came back incredibly long,"" Bezos told Charlie Rose in a 2016 interview .
Today, Amazon sells almost everything, from electronics to apparel. The retail giant also offers premium access to television shows, acquired Whole Foods and has plans to launch its own delivery service, according to The Wall Street Journal .
Bezos acknowledges that this ability to think long-term and experiment has contributed to Amazon's rapid success.
""We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"" Bezos told Rose . ""It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd.""

980,Chinese state-owned giant is hoping to expand in the US — with culture,"Cultural businesses may not be the most profitable, but China Poly Group will stay the course as the conglomerate expands into that U.S. sector, according to Xu Niansha, chairman of the Chinese enterprise.
The state-owned behemoth made its name as an arms dealer but is now a conglomerate with businesses spanning real estate to art. For one, its Hong Kong -listed culture arm runs one of the world's largest auction houses.
The firm's primary activities in the U.S. are culture and real estate .
Xu said Poly is unfazed by any changes in any country's government as long as foreign investment is welcomed because the company abides by laws of the land. Beyond that, he said, the company hasn't seen any meaningful shifts in attitude from the Trump administration.
""Poly came into the U.S. not only to earn money...Of course we hope that our projects are profitable but not only for this. The American market is a very strong market and a very advanced market. We can learn a lot of experience and technology with our U.S. partners and U.S. companies,"" Xu told CNBC at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
That's particularly true for cultural businesses, Xu said: ""In the two countries, the people need culture, so cultural exchange and communication is very important.""
The company has reportedly been ""pushing forward cooperation"" in U.S. cultural operations like performance and theater management.

2300,Pentagon defends airstrike that reportedly killed 'dozens' of Russian mercenaries in Syria,"CNBC.com Stringer | AFP | Getty Images Syrian pro-government members hold a position as they stand on the back of an armoured vehicle in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, on October 31, 2017, during an operation against Islamic State (IS) group jihadists. 
The Pentagon on Tuesday defended an airstrike on pro- Syrian government forces last week that reportedly killed ""dozens"" of Russian mercenaries. 
Reports have suggested more than 100 fighters supporting the regime led by Syrian President Bashar Assad were killed Feb. 7 in Syria's Deir al-Zor province when they attacked U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, who are fighting ISIS. 
""This was self defense,"" Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, said at a news briefing Tuesday. ""This is a hostile force launching an unprovoked, coordinated attack ... against an established SDF position."" 
There were an undisclosed number of U.S. coalition advisors on the ground with SDF fighters during the clash but they apparently didn't suffer casualties. Coalition forces called in airstrikes to halt an attack from pro-Assad forces. 
Secretive contract soldiers 
Some of those Russians killed were said to be mercenaries for the secretive Russian private military group Wagner, which has provided thousands of contract soldiers to help the Assad regime. 
Reuters reported the names of at least two Russian men fighting informally with pro-Assad forces who were killed in the incident in Deir al-Zor province, citing interviews with their associates. It said their associates also confirmed that ""dozens"" of other Russian fighters lost their lives in the same fighting on Feb. 7. 
However, Harrigian refused to speculate on the composition of the hostile force or whose control they were under but confirmed they supported the Assad government. He also wouldn't even confirm whether Russian nationals were among the dead in the attack. 
""We are focused on a singular enemy – ISIS,"" said the Air Force general. ""We are not looking for a fight with anyone else. But as [Defense] Secretary Mattis said last week, 'if you threaten us, it will be your longest and worst day.'"" 
According to Harrigian, the pro-Assad forces initiated the attack by firing artillery and tanks rounds at SDF positions. He said the battalion-sized group of fighters attempted to advance on the SDF ""under cover of supporting fires from artillery, tanks, and multiple launch rocket systems and mortars."" 
Harrigian said the U.S.-backed coalition contacted the Russians through the ""deconfliction"" telephone line to make them aware of the unprovoked attack. After these calls, he said the coalition officials gave the approval to conduct ""strikes to destroy hostile forces."" 
The U.S. counterattack involved the use of F-15 fighter jets, B-52 bombers, AC-130 gunships and Apache combat helicopters as well as MQ-9 Reaper drones. 
Harrigian said the attack by the pro-Assad forces was not a surprise since the U.S. and its partners had observed them engaged in a slow buildup the week before the attack. 'Deconfliction' hotline 
At the same time, the American military official said the U.S. had reminded the Russians on the deconfliction hotline about the SDF and the coalition's presence in the area. ""This was well in advance of the enemy forces attack,"" he said. 
Harrigian added that the deconfliction line with the Russians has been used on a daily basis in the region where the attack took place and he described conversations over the hotline as ""professional."" 
The pro-government forces were ""likely seeking to seize oil fields in Khusham"" east of the Euphrates in Deir al-Zor province, Reuters reported, citing a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Meantime, the Kremlin said Tuesday that it had no information about Russian mercenaries reportedly being killed in Syria. Moscow has never openly acknowledged that private military contractors have operated in Syria alongside its Russian armed forces. 
Russian law officially bans mercenary service. Yet it's been widely reported that Wagner and other shadowy private military groups operating out of Russia have sent soldiers to fight abroad in several conflicts.

190,Tiny SUVS are selling like crazy and struggling Ford wants in,"Ford badly needs profits, and bets selling more SUVs will bring them — even really tiny ones.
The company is rolling out its EcoSport subcompact SUV to dealerships now. With the move Ford wants to claim a piece of the fastest growing segment of the profitable and popular sport-utility market.
Profits are especially important for Ford right now, which is still very much in the middle of a turnaround, since appointing CEO Jim Hackett in early 2017. The second-largest U.S. automaker is trying to improve its financial fitness and erase a perception that it is behind both rival carmakers and tech firms on the development of new mobility technologies.
Ford shares were down nearly 5 percent on Thursday afternoon. 
Source: Ford Motor Company The Ford EcoSport The EcoSport is another step toward selling cars that will bring in more money. For one thing, subcompact SUVs are popular with buyers looking for a car that offers the ride height and flexible storage of SUVs in a nimbler package. It has been the fastest-growing segment in the U.S. since 2010, Ford said at an event with reporters on Thursday.
Since 2014 alone, sales of subcompact SUVs have more than tripled. About 425,000 subcompact SUVS sold in in 2017, and Ford expects that number to rise above half a million in 2018. Buick's Encore, for example, is that brand's best-selling model. 
They also command higher prices than comparable small cars. Average transaction prices for subcompact SUVs such as the EcoSport are $4,500 dollars higher than Ford would get from a subcompact car like the Fiesta, and $2,500 more than the company would get from the compact Focus, Ford said at an event with reporters on Thursday.
The EcoSport starts at around $20,000 but there are higher trim versions available, which allow Ford to charge more for the car at relatively little cost. Ford's sales of higher-trim SUVs, such as performance or luxury versions, make up 36 percent of all SUV sales.
The cars are attractive to young buyers looking for a versatile entry level car, and older buyers looking to downsize from larger SUV models. About 41 percent of subcompact SUV buyers are aged 45-64, and just over 20 percent are so-called millennials. 
The segment also attracts increasingly important demographics, such as culturally diverse buyers, and a higher share of women than the overall car market.
Ford released earnings on Wednesday that missed Wall Street expectations , and the company is facing some impatience from investors who are looking for more details on Hackett's plan to improve the company's future. Hackett's appointment generated a great deal of interest and enthusiasm on Wall Street. But the fact that Ford still has much work ahead of it is beginning to sink in. 
""Ultimately, while we agree with the long-term approach of Hackett, arguably, there won't be much to get excited about with the Ford story until 2019 or perhaps 2020,"" said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson in a research note on Thursday.",2018-01-25T22:26:00.000+02:00
1139,Valeant CEO looks to boost performance with price hikes and seven key products,"1 Hour Ago | 01:56 
Valeant CEO Joseph Papa projects ""single digit pricing increase"" on certain drugs and $1 billion portfolio of key products will help the drug maker fight debt and exclusivity challenges. 
""We received an approval for, really, what we think are seven fabulous products,"" Papa said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""If all of these products get approved, we think it is going to be an over $1 billion opportunity."" 
Papa took the reins of an embattled Valeant in 2016, amid accusations of fraud and price gouging in the company. 
Since then, he said he's put innovation at the forefront of a campaign to calm the tide of media attention and raise revenue in the face of mounting debt and the estimated $700 million lost from drug competition. 
""When I started, it was about was 18 months ago, it was all about putting together a plan for multiple years. And what we said is we have to come out with new innovation,"" Papa said. ""We have been fortunate to do that to offset and some of the declines of loss of exclusivity that were going to happen."" 
Papa is expected to discuss Valeant's recent performance and future Wednesday at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. A copy of Papa's presentation , published in advance online, identified seven significant products as Vyzulta, Lumify, and Ultra for Bausch + Lomb; Siliq, Duobrii and Jemdel from Ortho Dermatologics; and Relistor for Salix Pharmaceuticals. They are projected to raise more than $1 billion over the next five years 
Papa also said he anticipates the company will continue with price hikes, but with added awareness of its former reputation as a price gouger. Just last week, Valeant increased pricing on a number of drugs about 9 percent, an amount Papa called ""appropriate."" 
""We took a very appropriate response for what we needed to for pricing,"" Papa said, referring to the hike. ""We will continue with our patient access and pricing committee's stay to what we would refer to as a a single digit pricing increase.""

5088,Meet the 'special master' who will play a key role in the case of Trump lawyer Michael Cohen,"Barbara Jones, a former judge and prosecutor, has agreed to take on one of the most consequential jobs in the criminal investigation of President Donald Trump 's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen .
On Thursday, Federal Judge Kimba Wood appointed Jones, her former colleague, as a ""special master."" Jones is expected to determine which of the files, communications and electronics seized in the April 9 raids of Cohen's office and hotel room are protected by attorney-client privilege .
Jones brings with her extensive experience and qualifications for the job, but also some intriguing connections. Namely, she used to work under Rudy Giuliani when he was a U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the 1980s. The former New York City mayor and GOP presidential hopeful is now a member of Trump's legal team.
Yet it is exactly Jones' lengthy judicial career, and her diverse experience in law, that make her a prime choice for the role, according to Wood.
""In my view, the person best qualified to be special master in this case is Barbara Jones,"" Wood said.
A long and intriguing career Jones was selected by President Bill Clinton in 1995 as a judge in New York's Southern District, an appointment that came on the recommendation of late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-NY. She spent 17 years on the bench and presided over a wide array of cases, many of which involved questions of privilege.
Among her most famous cases involved Autumn Jackson, who was convicted in 1997 of attempting to extort millions of dollars from comedian Bill Cosby .
Cosby was convicted on three counts of aggravated sexual assault on Thursday — the same day Jones was appointed special master.
After she stepped down as a federal judge in early 2013, Jones acted as an arbitrator in the matter of National Football League running back Ray Rice, who had been suspended indefinitely after physically assaulting his fiancee in an elevator. Jones overturned his suspension.
In 2013, Jones made her first foray into private practice, joining the firm Zuckerman Spaeder. In the spring of 2016, she moved to become a partner at Bracewell, focusing on white collar issues. Jones joined Bracewell after Giuliani left his role as a name partner in the firm . Bracewell did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Jones' appointment.
She developed a particular expertise as an independent investigator in cases involving labor unions.
Over the course of her career, Jones cultivated a solid reputation, which was undiminished after Jones shifted to private practice. She received the Robert Morgenthau Award in 2016, an annual prize given to exemplary prosecutors, named after the famed New York district attorney.
""She is incredibly efficient,"" said Glen Kopp, a partner at Mayer Brown and a former colleague of Jones' at Bracewell. ""She can consume, absorb and make sense of a lot of information very quickly.""
Jones' ability to filter through the legal chaff will be tested in her new role as special master. She will be making determinations about the status of eight boxes' worth of hard-copy documents, and extractions from multiple cell phones, an iPad and other electronically stored files.
Kopp agreed with Wood that Jones is well-prepared for the task. She can ""see through whatever is superfluous and unnecessary and get right down to it,"" Kopp said.
Why a special master? The question of who would review Cohen's seized materials has been a lingering point of contention in the court proceedings. Lawyers for both Trump and Cohen have argued that their clients should be the first to determine which of the documents are covered by attorney-client confidentiality, meaning they can't be turned over to the prosecutors investigating Cohen.
Prosecuting attorneys for the federal government have strongly opposed those arguments, and for weeks fought against the appointment of a special master. But they relented on the latter point in a recent court filing, prompting Wood to make the appointment.
Wood cleared some of the air in the Thursday hearing, rejecting the seven special master candidates suggested by the parties in the case, and installing her own hand-picked selection instead.
Once Wood settled the matter of who would review Cohen's seized materials, the attorneys launched a lengthy debate over the scope of Jones' authority.
The lead prosecutor, Tom McKay, said that Jones should only be evaluating whether or not the materials were covered by Cohen's claims of privilege. Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, pushed to give Jones the power to determine if certain files, such as family medical records, were totally irrelevant to the matter at hand.
The two lawyers volleyed arguments back and forth for long enough that Joanna Hendon, a lawyer for Trump, at one point covered her face laughing in her seat.
Despite McKay's objection that giving the special master more powers would be a ""very serious expansion of the scope"" of the process that would ""dramatically"" slow it down, Wood appeared to grant Jones a small degree of leeway in the matter.",2018-04-29T15:04:00.000+03:00

Unrest in Iran erupted for a sixth-straight day Tuesday as demonstrators protest the countries economic troubles. 
The demonstrations, the country's biggest in years, were provoked by the high cost of living and widespread unemployment, challenging President Hassan Rouhani's economic policies. 
Clashes between protesters and security forces have resulted in hundreds of arrests and 21 deaths. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has blamed ""the enemies of Iran"" of meddling in the country's affairs. Rouhani, a moderate in the Islamic Republic leadership, has said the demonstrators are actually calling for ""more freedom,"" suggesting that the protesters are targeting hardliners rather than his government's policies.

7034,UPDATE 1-Brazil's truckers protest drags on despite dispatch of military,"UPDATE 1-Brazil's truckers protest drags on despite dispatch of military Flavia Bohone and Marcelo Teixeira Published 13 Hours Ago Reuters
(Updates with police, federal forces actions to clear roads)
SAO PAULO, May 26 (Reuters) - A truckers protest over diesel prices in Brazil that is hurting supplies of fuel, food and medicines continued for the sixth day on Saturday despite President Michel Temer ordering the military to clear blocked roads the day before.
Major cities have declared a state of emergency as gas stations and airports ran out of fuel, supermarket shelves went bare and hospitals said they were running out of supplies. Public transport and trash collection were reduced or halted across the country and prices for some food items jumped.
The government said there were fewer blockades on major highways across the country on Saturday compared to Friday. However, the main entity representing truckers, ABCAM, said they have not changed their main argument that they will call off protests only when federal taxes over diesel are scrapped.
Later on Saturday, federal forces and police appeared to be gaining an edge on clearing some roads. They were escorting convoys with fuel and other products in some areas in the country, including the airport in the capital Brasilia.
Negotiators for several trucker groups initially agreed on Thursday to suspend the protests as the government promised to subsidize and stabilize diesel prices, which may cost 5 billion reais ($1.4 billion) this year.
But truckers say they want a definitive solution, that they will end the protest only when a decision to eliminate federal diesel taxes is published in the official gazette.
Local TV showed footage overnight of federal forces being deployed to some critical areas to help police remove trucks from highways. There were no reports of violence, but main roads remained blocked in the morning.
Some business sectors that depend on daily supplies were suffering.
Lack of animal feed may cause the deaths of one billion birds and 20 million hogs, Brazilian meat group ABPA said, adding that more than 150 poultry and pork processing plants had indefinitely suspended production.
Brazil's sugar industry, the world's largest, is slowly halting cane harvest operations as machines ran out of fuel.
Blockades continue to prevent trucks from entering the port of Santos, Latin America's largest, and oilseeds crushing group Abiove said soy exports would halt on Saturday if truckers did not allow access to major ports.
Auto production, which contributes about a quarter of Brazil's industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday.
Authorities said even after roads are completely cleared, it would still take several days to normalize supplies. (Reporting by Flavia Bohone and Marcelo Teixeira Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas)",2018-05-27T00:13:00.000+03:00
606,This year's 'best' trades still deeply in the hole as crowd rushes in,"Venture Capital This year's 'best' trades still deeply in the hole as crowd rushes in Corporate tax cuts benefit smaller companies, and value stocks are a better bet when the economy is accelerating and rates are rising. Despite forecasts, these popular market plays are already deep in the hole for 2018, and it's still only January. The momentum of the 2017 market trends carrying into this year has been strong as record amounts of money rush into equities. SHARES Bryan R. Smith | AFP | Getty Images Traders work on the floor at the closing bell of the Dow Industrial Average at the New York Stock Exchange on January 17, 2018 in New York. 
Some of the most popular market plays for 2018 are already deep in the hole, before January is even two-thirds over. 
A broad consensus had formed among strategists and money managers heading into the year along a couple of fronts: Small-cap stocks should begin outperforming big ones after lagging in 2017, and cheaper value stocks would close the performance gap with growth. 
The reasoning was simple and clear: Corporate tax cuts will disproportionately benefit smaller companies with more domestic operations. And value stocks — which tend to be more cyclical — are a better bet when the economy is accelerating and rates are rising. 
It's early, but neither trade is working well. And the fast start for the broad benchmarks means the performance differential is already pretty stiff. 
Here's a look at how the very largest stocks, in the form of the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF ( MGK ), have easily outpaced the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF ( IWM ). 
Large versus small-cap stocks (MGK is blue, IWM is green) 
The growth-over-value split is slightly narrower, but still pretty pronounced so far, with the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ( IWF ) outpacing its value counterpart ( IWD ) by more than two percentage points so far in 2018. 
Growth versus value stocks ( IWF is blue, IWD is green) 
So what did the crowd get wrong? 
For one thing, the momentum of the 2017 market trends carrying into this year has been strong as new money has rushed into equities, at what Bank of America Merrill Lynch says is the heaviest four-week inflow in history. Investors are simply chasing the strength in the market and want broad exposure, rather than nuanced bets on particular segments linked to particular tax-exposure factors or style bets. 
As a broad rule, stock sectors don't follow a policy script all that closely. For instance, when taxes on dividends were cut dramatically in 2003, dividend-rich stocks didn't outperform a rising market. Also, very large stocks often lead in the later phases of a bull market. And while the earnings-growth boost from lower taxes will be significant for many smaller stocks this year, that doesn't mean the market has decided to shun the giant growth stocks that promise double-digit profit gains for years to come. 
That also explains why value stocks have done fine, but haven't kept pace with Big Tech and other growth leaders. 
It might take substantially higher interest rates to get financial stocks — a huge chunk of value indexes— on a sustained surge, and to finally compress the valuations of those richly valued ""organic growth"" FANG-type names. 
Not every popular call has come up short this month, of course. Strategists in general have been preaching the wisdom of tilting toward non-U.S. stocks, which as a group have been slightly outperforming the U.S. indexes. This also is a ""tell"" that the sped-up rally lately has been about a lot more than the Republican tax cut. 
And banks are also a broadly loved group, for many obvious reasons relating to taxes, deregulation and higher rates. They've slightly outpaced the S&P 500 so far after lagging a bit last year. 
Much can change as a year goes on; the leadership profile of the market shifted hard and unexpectedly in the first quarter last year from deeply cyclical and financial stocks to FANG-like growth giants.

4276,"Toys R Us bankruptcy created 'the perfect storm' for Ollie's Bargain Outlet, says CEO","19 Hours Ago | 00:55 
Since its 2015 public offering, Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings has gained traction in the market. So when Toys R Us liquidated its U.S. business in March, Ollie's CEO Mark Butler seized the day. 
""I think this is the perfect storm for us,"" Butler, also the chairman of Ollie's, told CNBC's Jim Cramer in a Thursday interview on "" Mad Money ."" 
For Ollie's, Butler said the advantages are twofold. First, ""there's going to be a lot of product that's going to be available because these manufacturers are losing one of their number one, if not their number one customer,"" he told Cramer. 
Second, Toys R Us was largely a brick-and-mortar retailer, which could mean increased traffic at other brick-and-mortar stores that sell toys like Ollie's, Butler said. 
""Hopefully, a lot of [Toys R Us customers] or many of them or some of them are going to come to Ollie's and buy toy closeouts,"" the CEO said. ""I think it's a win-win on both sides of the equation for us."" 
Ollie's Bargain Outlet is a Pennsylvania-based retail chain specializing in discount closeout merchandise and excess inventory. With 274 stores across 22 states, the company has been growing since its 2015 public offering, an unusual trend for the somewhat crippled retail sector. 
Ollie's most recent quarter , reported Wednesday, beat Wall Street estimates yet again, topping off what Butler called ""our biggest, our best, our brightest year ever."" 
The retailer's rewards program, Ollie's Army, has grown with the company, now boasting nearly nine million members. 
Butler attributed the rise to a ""trade-down effect"" after the financial crisis, ""where people really needed to save money, and they liked it."" 
And while bankruptcies in the retail space can be devastating for the retailers themselves and their customers, Ollie's tends to be a posthumous winner. 
""It usually takes a little bit of time for the pain to set in until [we] become attractive on the leasing side,"" Butler admitted. ""But we pay, we revitalize shopping centers, we bring a lot of customers and, you know, that's why our parking lots are packed, our stores are rockin'.""

6640,Victoria's Secret has a plan to revamp its image for younger women,"show chapters Victoria's Secret and L Brands faces competition from Amazon and more 4 Hours Ago | 01:24 Victoria's Secret is trying to attract younger women and win back former customers by focusing on core categories, such as apparel and lingerie.
Jan Singer, CEO of Victoria's Secret Lingerie said the company is doing this by understanding the needs of its clients.
""It's not a one size fits all,"" Singer said on Thursday morning's conference call. ""She's in our store. She's in our site. We have that data.""
On Wednesday, L Brands , the parent company to Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works and Pink, reported first-quarter earnings that were nearly half the size of the year-ago period. Overall sales rose 8 percent to $2.62 billion. But looking specifically at Victoria's Secret, same-store sales, a key retail metric, plummeted 14 percent, and the retailer cut its 2018 earnings forecast. The stock plunged more than 6 percent after hours Wednesday.
But the stock quickly reversed during Thursday morning's conference call, trading nearly 2 percent higher, as the company laid out its plan to attract a younger demographic and grow its lounge wear, sleepwear and sportswear collections.
Singer mentioned the Victoria's Secret Illusions Collection, bras that offer non-slip support, several times during the call as one of its most popular offerings.
Still, shares of the parent company L Brands are down about 40 percent year-to-date. The once dominant player in intimate apparel, Victoria's Secret has been steadily losing market share in the last few years with its collection overtly sexy lingerie and bedazzled panties that many women say are a turnoff.
Miri Gregory, a 34-year-old chef in San Diego, said she used to shop at Victoria's Secret for all her bras, but she stopped going because the selection got ""horrible.""
""I'm not a big froufrou kind of a person,"" Gregory said. ""No lacy things for me.""
Turns out these are common complaints.
Scott Mlyn | CNBC Shoppers pass by a Victoria's Secret store. Even the company's Pink line, once a growth driver for the company, is struggling as consumer preferences shift.
""When Victoria's Secret started putting all the words on the butt, it totally turned me off to the whole brand. I didn't even want to go into the place,"" said Christine Lord of Fort Collins, Colorado. ""There was a time when I thought it was classier.""
""Our view is simple: VS is broken, PINK is breaking … we question the sustainability of LB's regular dividend and believe a reduction here could be a wake up call for current holders,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, in a research note.
Konik anticipates more downward earnings revisions, and set a price target of $23 for the stock, which currently trades at about $35.
Consumers have favored athleisure garments that can be worn for both exercising and lounging, and the category continues to be a source of growth in the apparel market. U.S. sales of bralettes, or bras without wires or melt cups, increased more than 30 percent in both units and dollars in the period from March 2017 to March 2018, according to The NPD Group's Retail Tracking Service.
Adam Jeffery | CNBC Marshal Cohen, chief industry advisor at The NPD Group, said the trend illustrates the consumers' desire for comfort and specialty products.
But it's not just the emergence of increased casual wear that makes Victoria's Secret less appealing. The brand is also competing with online stores and a myriad of independent shops for customer attention — customers who often value convenience and who don't have the same brand loyalty of previous generations. In addition, women are craving models with more realistic body types, something that's hard to find among Victoria's Secret's tribe of airbrushed supermodels.
In an email to CNBC, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail said he has issues with the brand's ""tone and image.""
""The dark environment, the conspicuous sexuality of the offer and the brash marketing are increasingly out of step with what modern consumers want,"" he said.

He estimates Ford's F-series truck business is worth about $16 per share alone, showing how undervalued the company is overall, according to his estimates.
The analyst said approximately 30 percent of demand for the Ford F-150 truck is from nonresidential construction. He said every 5 percentage-point increase in the company's U.S. truck unit sales drives Ford's profits higher by an incremental 10 percentage points.
""A recovery of the price of oil also boosts pickup truck demand more than investors may realize (Texas is the world's largest pickup truck market),"" he wrote. ""We also believe there is potential for any US infrastructure spending to be an incremental positive for Ford. … Ford has some attributes that make it arguably a cheap machinery stock with leverage to any infrastructure spending.""
Ford shares have underperformed the market this year. Its shares declined 14 percent year to date compared with the S&P 500's 3 percent return through Tuesday.

7094,"Companies hire 204,000 more workers in April despite signs of tightening job market: ADP","7 Hours Ago | 01:51
Hiring continued at a solid pace in April, with private companies adding 204,000 positions even amid signs of a tightening jobs market, according to a report Wednesday from ADP and Moody's Analytics.
The number was essentially in line with expectations of economists surveyed by Reuters who had forecast 200,000. The total did indicate a slight deceleration from March, which posted a downward revised 228,000 from an initially reported 241,000.
Job growth was broad-based, with gains coming not only from a number of service-based sectors but also goods-producing areas including construction, which added 27,000 positions.
April also represented the ADP/Moody report's sixth-straight month of private payroll growth above 200,000.
""Despite rising trade tensions, more volatile financial markets, and poor weather, businesses are adding a robust more than 200,000 jobs per month,"" Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi said in a statement. ""At this pace, unemployment will soon be in the threes, which is rarefied and risky territory, as the economy threatens to overheat.""
The national jobless rate currently sits at 4.1 percent and near what economists consider full employment. However, payrolls continue to increase a strong pace.
A jobless rate in below 4 percent would represent ""awfully risky"" territory, Zandi told CNBC's "" Squawk Box ."" Economists worry that more downward pressure on the jobless rate will result in rapid wage growth that will lead to inflation.
""It's going to be tough to navigate and land the plane when you're in the 3s,"" Zandi said, though he added that the continued pace of job gains above 200,000 a month is ""fantastic growth.""
Economists sometimes use the ADP number as a guide for their estimate of the government's official nonfarm payrolls count, due Friday. Expectations currently are for an increase in that report of about 195,000. The two counts can differ sharply, however, as ADP's March estimate was well above the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 103,000 tally.
According to ADP/Moody's, services-related industries created 160,000 jobs while goods producers added 44,000.
""The labor market continues to maintain a steady pace of strong job growth with little sign of a slowdown,"" said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. ""However, as the labor pool tightens it will become increasingly difficult for employers to find skilled talent.""
Leading sectors included professional and business services (58,000), education and health (39,000) and leisure and hospitality (36,000). Manufacturing contributed 10,000 while natural resources and mining added another 7,000.
From a business size standpoint, the contribution was evenly distributed, with companies employing 50 to 499 workers adding 88,000, small firms hiring 62,000 and large companies growing by 54,000.
Franchises posted the only decline for the month, losing 10,600 positions.",2018-05-02T15:15:00.000+03:00
1060,Don't mock LeBron James Instagram self-congratulation—it's a great lesson in success,"CNBC.com David Liam Kyle | Getty Images LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers reacts during the game against the Chicago Bulls on October 24, 2017. SHARES 
NBA star LeBron James is known for exuding confidence on social media. On Tuesday, he celebrated a significant milestone on Instagram before even lacing up his sneakers. And while his post might have been considered premature, causing some people to poke fun , that kind of confidence could be a key component to his success. 
Here's how. Visualizing success helps you achieve it 
The path to success starts in your head, experts say, and those who can picture victory, like James, might just have a competitive edge. 
On Tuesday, James took to Instagram to congratulate his younger self ahead of what would soon be a monumental moment in his athletic career. 
The basketball star is currently sitting on 29,993 career points, and he was expected to hit the 30,000 threshold — a milestone only a handful of other players have hit — later that night in a game against the San Antonio Spurs. 
""Wanna be one of the first to Congratulate you on this accomplishment/achievement tonight that you'll reach! Only a handful has reach/seen it too and while I know it's never been a goal of yours from the beginning try (please try) to take a moment for yourself on how you've done it!"" James wrote, with a picture of himself from years ago. 
""The House you're about to be apart of has only 6 seats in it (as of now) but 1 more will be added and you should be very proud and honored to be invited inside. There's so many people to thank who has help this even become possible (so thank them all) and when u finally get your moment (alone) to yourself smile, look up to the higher skies and say THANK YOU! So with that said, Congrats again Young King!"" 
By imagining his future success, James is harnessing the power of visualization, a powerful mental tool often used by athletes, business-people and performers alike. Picturing victory has been touted by psychologists as a way to prepare for a slew of situations, and research has shown it helps improve focus and performance, even if it can also lead some Twitter users to get salty. TWEET 
Athletes especially — from Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn to swimmer Missy Franklin — use similar mental techniques to prepare for competitions. At the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, the U.S. Olympic Committee was expected to have eight sports psychologists on hand in order to maximize the team's potential, the Washington Post reported. At least one study has even linked mental training to muscle strength: It found that people who simply conducted mental exercises of weight training in their heads increased muscle strength by 13.5 percent. 
""I think the mental side of the game is way over 50 percent, probably about 80 percent,"" James said in a YouTube video . Success takes hard work, too 
It takes more than a mental workout and posting a confident Instagram to break records, though. It takes hard work. 
James' success on the basketball court wasn't necessarily a slam dunk. He's had to earn it. Since being drafted to the Cavaliers in 2003, James has gotten the respect of his peers, and he's now known within the sport for his work ethic. 
""Most guys are either big talkers or big workers. He's both,"" Kyle Korver, James' teammate on the Cavaliers, previously told NBA.com ""He's without a doubt the leader of this team. He's always telling everybody where to go — I mean, every possession. Offensive, defensive. I've never seen anyone communicate like he does out on the court. 
""Then behind the scenes, just how hard he works. He's a machine. You don't see guys this late in their careers, guys who've had this much success, be the first guy in the gym. He's still there."" 
Basketball legend Magic Johnson has also touted James' talent and work ethic. ""He's special because he makes his teammates better and yet still plays at a high level himself,"" Johnson told CNBC in June , adding that he's a, ""special guy, special player, one of the greatest that has ever laced them up."" 
""The LeBron Jameses of the world come around every 20 years,"" Johnson said. 
The 30,000-point threshold is noteworthy, according to Bleacher Report , because only six players in NBA history have gotten there: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Dirk Nowitzki. James, 33, would reportedly become the youngest to reach 30,000 points. show chapters ",2018-01-24T00:44:00.000+02:00

2565,"Trump pressures Pelosi, Democrats on DACA a week before the next possible government shutdown","President Donald Trump on Thursday broke a two-day tweetless streak in part by pressuring Democrats over negotiations to preserve a program that protects people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
Trump, who ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, tweeted that Democrats ""are doing nothing"" about the program.
@realDonaldTrump: March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!
Trump's combative tweet came nearly two days after he sought bipartisan cooperation on immigration and other issues during his State of the Union address . It is also one week before the government is slated, yet again, to run out of funding.
Last month, the government shut down for three days before lawmakers reached a deal to extend funding. As part of the agreement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell assured Democrats there would be a debate on DACA before the Feb. 8 deadline.
Trump's tweet didn't mention the Feb. 8 deadline. Instead, it focused on the day DACA is slated to end for good, March 5. A federal judge, however, recently blocked the Trump administration from ending the program, which shields nearly 800,000 young immigrants from deportation.
Trump has said he supports a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants, a figure that includes DACA recipients and those who are eligible for the program but have not signed up for it. There's strong bipartisan support among lawmakers for preserving DACA, as well.
However, he has insisted on billions of dollars to fund a wall along the Mexican border, and immigration hardliners in the Republican Party have opposed or expressed skepticism about protecting DACA-eligible immigrants.
While any DACA fix is expected to have wide support among both caucuses in the Senate, its approval is more in doubt in the House, potentially setting up a headache for Speaker Paul Ryan . The so-called ""Hastert rule"" posits that a majority of the majority party should support a bill if it is to pass.
Signs of conservative opposition became more prevalent Thursday morning. Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said during a GOP policy retreat that a deal only focusing on border security and DACA is a nonstarter. Meadows said he supports a ""four pillars"" approach like what Trump proposed in his State of the Union – including a DACA fix, enhanced border security, scrapping a visa lottery system, and limiting family sponsorship and reunification, which is known derisively as ""chain migration.""
@ylanmui: .@RepMarkMeadows: Border security/DACA deal only is a nonstarter.
Trump's tweet Thursday, however, singled out House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic caucus to ""work out a DACA fix, NOW!""

They also criticized President Trump for doing too little to address the issue. The report recommends setting up an organization similar to the National Counterterrorism Center to coordinate the U.S. reaction to such meddling. Published 1 Hour Ago Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk across Red Square past St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. 
Democratic U.S. lawmakers called on President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday to treat foreign election interference as a national crisis, setting up a single agency to coordinate the response and establishing a new class of sanctions to quickly punish those responsible. 
Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report on Wednesday detailing what they described as nearly two decades of Russian efforts to influence elections elsewhere in Europe, and criticizing Trump for doing too little to address the issue. 
Senator Ben Cardin , the committee's ranking Democrat, commissioned the report after Trump's surprise November 2016 election victory. The report was released a year after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign to benefit Trump, the Republican candidate, and undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. 
Moscow has denied any such effort. Trump dismisses such assertions as sour grapes about his victory. 
The document consists of eight chapters and several appendices detailing tools the Senate investigators said Russia used to influence elections in Europe and making more than 30 recommendations for how to prevent further interference in elections in Europe, the United States and other countries. 
The investigators accused Moscow of trying to undermine democracies by spreading malicious disinformation, threatening countries' energy security and using ""cybercriminals"" to steal information. 
""President Trump must be clear-eyed about the Russian threat, take action to strengthen our government's response and our institutions, and ... work with an international coalition to counter the threat and assert our values,"" Cardin said in a statement. 
The report's recommendations included working to build democratic institutions in countries most vulnerable to election interference, and set up an organization similar to the National Counterterrorism Center to coordinate the U.S. reaction to such meddling. 
They also called on Washington, and its allies, to freeze ""dirty"" Kremlin money and release publicly any intelligence on Russian President Vladimir Putin's assets stored abroad. 
""The Russian government's use of corruption and money laundering also merit additional examination by relevant committees in Congress, as well as the Executive Branch,"" the report said. 
It called on Washington to specially designate any country that seeks to influence others as a ""State Hybrid Threat Actors,"" subjected to preemptive sanctions, and called on social media companies to do comprehensive audits on how their platforms might have been used to influence elections. 
The report's release coincides with deepening rifts between Republicans, who control Congress, and Democrats over congressional investigations into Russia and the election. Some Republican lawmakers have been casting doubt on those probes, and one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , a former FBI Director. ",2018-01-10T18:21:00.000+02:00

""On the team and business side, that's exactly what we're about.""

Gelman is the CEO of Kraft Analytics Group, which was formed in 2016 after being spun out of the Kraft Sports Group, which owns the New England Patriots. Gelman co-founded the conference with Daryl Morey, the general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets.

""Daryl and I always have a few things up our sleeves,"" Gelman told CNBC. ""President Obama is an innovative mind and we're so honored he wants to be part of this conference, which 12 years ago was just a few people in MIT classrooms.""

This year's conference will have 3,500 attendees and 37 panels. Some other high profile first-time attendees include Steve Ballmer, Alex Rodriguez, Ted Leonsis, and Jeremy Lin.

""This year has been our most in-demand by far in terms of ticket requests,"" said Gelman.
""We've got 31 competitive advantage talks, workshops, a trade show, a start-up competition, a hackathon, and much more."" 

Gelman told CNBC that many people have gotten their start in sports from the conference, including high-level analytics executives at major pro teams. 

""This year's theme is 'talk data to me',"" Gelman said. ""We have all this data and now it's about harnessing it and communicating it.""",2018-02-20T09:28:00.000+02:00

16,"Gamer anger over 'microtransactions' will hurt Activision, Electronic Arts: Analyst","CNBC.com Chesnot | Getty Images Gamers play the video game 'Destiny 2' developed by Bungie Studios and published by Activision during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 31, 2017 in Paris, France. 
The controversy over in-game microtransactions will have a lasting negative impact on game publishers, according to one Wall Street firm. 
Cowen reiterated its market perform ratings for Activision Blizzard's and Electronic Arts' shares, citing increasing development costs. 
""Game development times are getting longer, and R&D costs are growing faster than they had previously,"" analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""This isn't a monopoly business … Angering your customer with bad MTX [microtransactions] does matter."" 
Creutz reaffirmed his $66 price target for Activision Blizzard shares, representing 7 percent downside to Thursday's close. He also reiterated his $104 price target for EA stock, which is 9 percent lower than Thursday's close. 
The analyst said research and development spending growth is accelerating for gaming companies. He noted R&D budgets for the four largest publishers grew at roughly a 1 percent annual rate from 2010 to 2015, then rose to more than 8 percent per year the last two years. 
Creutz said the outrage over the initial money-making strategy in EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" likely hurt the title's sales by 3 million to 4 million units versus the company's 14 million guidance. He noted Activision's ""Destiny 2"" player engagement is waning after the community questioned the game's design decisions. 
The ""industry plans to further expand live services revenue appear to have run into some roadblocks with gamers sounding off against some recent titles, notably EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" and Activision's ""Destiny 2"" (though the issues with the latter go beyond just MTX),"" he wrote. ""We think writing off angry gamers as largely irrelevant is a mistake."" 
He added: 
""[Star Wars Battlefront II] has pretty clearly significantly underperformed expectations and remains without a live services revenue stream, while Destiny 2 has at the least suffered some unwanted engagement attrition. We suspect that 2018 will see a pullback on industry attempts to aggressively drive MTX growth as a result."" 
The analyst also warned gaming industry stocks may falter due to high expectations. 
""Current valuations are pricing in an awful lot of good news, with an investor base that seems at least somewhat complacent,"" he wrote. ""It's not just that gamers are angry and complaining; there have clearly been performance consequences for the games involved. And in an industry where every company is dependent upon a relatively small number of franchises, this matters."" 
Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",2018-01-26T21:38:00.000+02:00
3120,"Tillerson's firing raises doubts about the Iran nuclear deal, injects uncertainty into oil markets","President Donald Trump injected fresh uncertainty into oil markets on Tuesday by removing Rex Tillerson from his post as secretary of State and replacing him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo , a foreign policy hawk.
The staff shakeup installs an ardent critic of the Iran nuclear deal as the nation's top diplomat and narrows the difference of opinion between the White House and the State Department, analysts say. Tillerson's firing also removes another member of the administration's internationalist wing and emboldens Trump to take more punitive measures against rivals, including Iran and Venezuela, they warn.
That could raise the geopolitical risk premium in oil markets and ultimately disrupt crude output, potentially sending prices higher as supply tapers off at a time of robust oil demand.
""We are probably looking at both the U.S. exiting the Iran deal and the U.S. imposing more sanctions on Venezuela, and both of those are pretty bullish for oil,"" said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
Leah Millis | Reuters Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks to the media at the U.S. State Department after being fired by President Donald Trump in Washington, March 13, 2018. The Iran nuclear deal has been in peril since Trump disavowed the accord in October. Under the agreement, Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program and agreed to international inspections. In exchange, the United States and international partners suspended sanctions, allowing Iran to restore its lost oil production.
Trump waived U.S. sanctions in January , but said he would not do so again unless his administration reached a deal with European allies to toughen the terms of the deal and address Iran's ballistic missile tests. He set a deadline for May.
""The likelihood of those being renewed is probably now more uncertain,"" said Arun Pillai-Essex, a senior political risk analyst at Verisk Maplecroft.
That does not mean the deal is doomed, Pillai-Essex said, but he noted that Trump and Pompeo have similar views on the deal. Tillerson was among a group of deputies who counseled the president against scrapping the accord.
Thus far, European signatories to the deal — including Germany, France and the UK — have not signaled a strong willingness to make major concessions, Pillai-Essex said. 
show chapters White House turnover is ‘unprecedented’: Atlantic Council CEO      5 Hours Ago | 05:18 By choosing Pompeo as Tillerson's successor, Trump is increasing pressure on Europe to agree to changes to the deal, said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a long-time critic of the accord.
""The appointment of Mike Pompeo is a message to the Europeans that they better fix the fatally flawed Iran deal by May 12, or the president will take America out of the deal and reimpose the most powerful economic sanctions on their companies and banks, who are enriching the Iranian regime,"" he said.
An American exit from the Iran nuclear deal is unlikely to immediately upend oil markets, said Croft. It would take time for renewed sanctions to squeeze Iranian oil supplies, although the market could begin pricing risk into crude prices.
There was little evidence of that premium on Tuesday, as oil prices were sharply lower, dragged down by concerns about surging U.S. crude production.
The administration could have a more immediate impact on the oil market if it decides to ratchet up sanctions in Venezuela, where economic crisis and mismanagement have caused sharp declines in the petro-state's crude output, said Croft.
show chapters Tillerson's exit has 'very big implications' for oil: RBC's Helima Croft      2 Hours Ago | 07:16 Trump has already taken measures to prevent Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from restructuring debt held by the government and state-owned oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA.
RBC Capital Markets expects a drop of 700,000 to 800,000 barrels day this year absent new sanctions, but Croft says the country could lose more than a million barrels a day if the United States introduces additional penalties.
""I'm surprised market participants are not realizing the implications of 'Rexit,'"" Croft said, referring to the nickname given to Tillerson's exit from the administration.
""Getting someone like Pompeo in that seat means the U.S. may be far more willing to impose sanctions,"" she said.",2018-03-13T21:29:00.000+02:00

4642,FBI raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen sent shockwaves through GOP leadership ranks,"The FBI raids conducted against President Donald Trump 's longtime personal attorney have sent shockwaves through Republican leadership ranks as Democrats look to flip both houses of Congress in November's midterm elections.
Political operatives close to congressional GOP leadership are shaken after the FBI raided the office and residence of the lawyer, Michael Cohen , on Monday. These external advisors spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity as they are heavily involved with the elections.
Republican political advisors think the issue could push voters away from the GOP agenda and give Democrats a big boost in the midterms.
""Among strategists, concern is at an all-caps level,"" said one Republican strategist who is close to Senate leaders. 
The reason for the fear, this strategist said, comes from uncertainty about how the president may react, including possibly firing special counsel Robert Mueller, who reportedly made the referral leading to the Cohen raid, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who reportedly signed off on the raids .
Trump on Monday called the investigation ""an attack on our nation.""
There also appears to be a concern, the strategist said, about potential charges being brought against Cohen, who is one of Trump's closest confidants. Cohen is known to have extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the Trump Organization.
""Most operatives are monitoring the situation closely with the hope for some sign of relief,"" the strategist said. ""I don't think anybody knows what to expect. To us, the unknown is the scariest part.""
Another strategist close to GOP leaders shared similar concerns — and called for Republicans to distance themselves from the situation before it hurts them in November.
""I imagine people are watching closely while trying to stay as far away as possible,"" the GOP operative told CNBC.
Silence from GOP donors Republican donors, on the other hand, have remained silent on the news about Cohen, who was named deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee a year ago .
GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson , CEO and chairman of casino giant Las Vegas Sands , hasn't yet privately expressed an opinion about the investigation into Trump's loyal comrade, associates close to the billionaire told CNBC on the condition of anonymity.
Adelson was a big backer of Trump's run for president in 2016, giving more than $10 million to the pro-Trump super PAC Future45, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. So far in 2018, he has contributed minimally to the congressional elections, but people close to him say that's expected to change before Election Day.
Getty Images Michael Cohen, a personal attorney for President Trump, departs from a House Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill, October 24, 2017 in Washington, DC. A spokesman for Adelson declined to comment.
Leaders of another donor group, the pro-Trump America First Action Super PAC, declined to comment about the raid specifically. But one top figure at the PAC did tell CNBC that he believed Cohen was not guilty.
""I'm not a lawyer but I know Michael Cohen. I know he wouldn't break the law. He always dots his I's and crosses his T's. I know he's loyal to President Trump,"" Roy Bailey, Dallas financier and finance chairman of the group, told CNBC.
Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and real estate tycoon Geoffrey Palmer, both top donors to the Trump's re-election campaign, declined to comment about the raid.
Potential peril for Cohen and the GOP CNBC twice reached out directly to Cohen, who said he would call back.
""Hey Brian,"" Cohen told a CNBC reporter. ""I'm in the middle of something. You can imagine. I will call you back.""
He still hadn't called back before this story's publication. Cohen's attorney also did not return requests for comment, nor did White House attorney Ty Cobb or Jay Sekulow, the president's outside counsel in the Russia probe.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., did not return a request for comment.
Democratic strategists see the Cohen investigation as another way to appeal to voters as the election season heats up.
""It could add to more of the Democratic wave because of just the general sense that the president and people around him are out of control,"" Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf told CNBC. ""Republicans appear to be paralyzed. They can't go up to take on the president, at least that's how they feel. They just don't know what to do. They've never been in a situation like this.""
Even before the raids, polls showed Republicans trailing Democrats in congressional approval ratings.
A recent poll by Quinnipiac University shows 48 percent of voters want the Democratic Party to win control of the House while 38 percent want Republicans to control the chamber. The poll also said 49 percent of voters believe Democrats should win control of the Senate, compared with 39 percent who want the GOP to maintain a majority.",2018-04-10T20:48:00.000+03:00
4754,AMD stock jumps after chipmaker's earnings top estimates,"AMD shares jumped 11 percent on Wednesday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected first quarter results.
Earnings: 11 cents per share, excluding certain items, vs. 9 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $1.65 billion vs. $1.57 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. AMD also provided a forecast that topped estimates. The company said it's expecting $1.72 billion in revenue, give or take $50 million, in the second quarter, compared to analyst expectations for sales of $1.58 billion.
Revenue in the first quarter jumped 40 percent year over year, AMD said . The biggest gains came from the company's Computing and Graphics Business Segment, which climbed 95 percent to $1.12 billion.
By the end of the year, AMD expects that companies will come out with 60 systems based on its Ryzen PC chip architecture by the end of the year, CEO Lisa Su said on a conference call with analysts after the earnings report came out.
AMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment declined 12 percent to $532 million, primarily due to a drop in semi-custom revenue, which includes chips customized for game console makers. The semi-custom decline is connected to a gain in licensing business that happened in the first quarter of last year -- specifically around a gaming console.
With its Epyc server chips, AMD has been trying to gain share in a market dominated by Intel. The chipmaker continues to expect to have mid-single-digit server chip unit share by the end of the year, Su said.
""I will say, for the first-generation Epyc, we're seeing really nice customer interest, and it's quite broad. And so it is across enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers. And we view this as a multigenerational play, so we're very excited about what Epyc can do over the next couple of quarters,"" Su said.
show chapters Bulls bet on AMD, this financial play 2:27 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 02:22 ""But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set as we bring out the second generation of Epyc and the third generation of Epyc, obviously, it would go a little bit faster, because the customer set us as a familiar with our system.""
AMD will sample the second-generation Epyc chips later this year but will only put it into production next year, Su said. That means Su's unit share estimate for this year solely relies on sales of the first version of the chip.
Meanwhile, big companies operating large data centers have been testing out an AMD Radeon graphics card for accelerating artificial intelligence workloads, Su said.
Blockchain represented 10 percent of the company's revenue in the quarter, CFO Devinder Kumar said. In the second quarter, there will be a decline in graphics revenue in connection to blockchain, which will partly offset acceleration in semi-custom revenue, Kumar said.
In the first quarter, AMD gained share from Nvidia in the graphics card market and took share from Intel in the desktop chip market, analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group said in a note on April 4.
AMD shares are down 5.5 percent since the beginning of the year, as of Wednesday's close. During the quarter AMD reckoned with the fallout from the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities. But Su said at this point the company doesn't see them to have long-term effects on the business.

3067,The Trump administration is teetering,"MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. — The Trump administration is teetering.
President Donald Trump just fired his top diplomat .
His top economic advisor resigned last week.
His personal assistant in the White House has been dismissed and escorted out of the executive mansion.
His fourth communications director quit a few days ago after acknowledging she had lied to protect Trump.
His staff secretary was ousted after public revelations of domestic abuse that other aides had kept hidden.
Trump's son-in-law, a top White House aide, has been stripped of his top security clearance. 
His current national security advisor is rumored to soon be leaving his job.
The president's aides, political associates and international allies treat his public declarations as empty chatter.
Aaron P. Bernstein | Reuters Donald Trump Trump enunciated gun restrictions after the Parkland school massacre, then backtracked after fellow Republicans and the National Rifle Association objected. That mirrored his previous handling of the fate of immigrant Dreamers and health-care marketplace stabilization.
He said his steel tariffs would hit Canada and Mexico unless they concluded a new North American Free Trade Agreement. Then he backtracked, without a new NAFTA, after fellow Republicans and U.S. allies warned against a trade war and threatened retaliation.
The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election has indicted the former chairman of Trump's presidential campaign . Special counsel Robert Mueller has also secured guilty pleas from Trump's former White House national security advisor , deputy campaign chief and campaign foreign policy adviser — all of whom are now cooperating witnesses.
Trump's lawyers, who have repeatedly portrayed the investigation as on the verge of ending, are discussing terms under which Mueller can question the president himself about potential collusion with Russia and subsequent obstruction of justice.
All these winds buffet the White House as Trump faces hazards, largely of his own making, on several fronts.
He rattled markets with the threat of trade disruptions to a strong global economy.
He caught national security aides unprepared by agreeing to become the first sitting president to meet with North Korea's nuclear-armed dictator. The administration has articulated no clear U.S. strategy for a meeting South Korea's leader says will occur within two months.
Trump declined to promptly speak up in solidarity with America's foremost ally after the prime minister of Britain pointed at Russia for the attempted murder of an expatriate on British soil.
He has remained silent as an actress in pornographic films is on the verge of publicly telling her story of a pre-White House affair with him. Trump's personal lawyer paid $130,000 for her silence on the eve of the 2016 election.
For now, despite his sub-40 percent approval ratings, Trump enjoys political protection from fellow Republicans who control both houses of Congress.
But that protection may not survive the year. Here in southwest Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in Tuesday's special House election took a late polling lead in a district Trump won in a landslide.
If Conor Lamb breaks the GOP's 16-year grip on this district, Republicans will confront the prospect of midterm defeats large enough to make more incumbents reconsider their appetite for the battle.
And if Democrats win back Congress in November, Trump will not merely be standing on shaky political ground. He'll be staring directly at the prospect of impeachment.

5600,IBM's blockchain team is led by women. Here's why it's a big deal for Silicon Valley,"In the male-dominated world of cryptocurrency , IBM is going against the grain. The company's 1,500 member blockchain team is led by Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of global industries, platforms and blockchain. Meanwhile, the actual blockchain development was led by IBM Fellow Donna Dillenberger.
With the tremendous surge in bitcoin's popularity over the last year, blockchain, which is the platform behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has received renewed interest among large corporations and smaller entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the digital gold rush. IBM is one of a long list of companies that have now built their own blockchain platform.
However, the company's predominantly female leadership lies in stark contrast to other blockchain start-ups, which are overwhelmingly run by men. It also makes the company an anomaly within a fintech industry that remains heavily male-dominated. However, Kralingen, who joined the company in 2004, notes that promoting women to leadership positions isn't a new trend at IBM. The company's CEO, Ginni Rometty , is the most visible example.
Joshua Roberts | Reuters President and CEO of IBM Ginni Rometty Dillenberger agrees. ""I've worked with extremely, and many, gifted technical and creative women,"" she tells CNBC Make It . ""We were just having a design meeting this morning with our female lead for security in blockchain and she is brilliant.""
Dillenberger was tapped as the company's lead blockchain engineer when she became an IBM Fellow in 2015, which is the highest technical honor at the company. Out of 370,000 IBM employees, she is currently one of just 99 Fellows. In IBM's nearly 107-year history, there have only been 289 Fellows, five of whom are Nobel Prize winners.
How IBM hires Kralingen says IBM was ""intentional"" in choosing who would spearhead the blockchain platform development. The company focused on skills-based hiring because leaders realized early on that it would take a diverse group of talent to make IBM an undisputed leader in blockchain technology.
""[By focusing on skills] we've been able to get a really extremely high-caliber, smart, capable, energized team,"" Kralingen tells CNBC Make It . The company's blockchain platform has received various accolades and was ranked as the No. 1 blockchain industry leader.
show chapters These are the most desirable companies to work for in 2017      6:30 AM ET Thu, 18 May 2017 | 00:46 Dillenberger notes that blockchain has many uses outside of cryptocurrency and she highlights food safety as an example. Using a cellphone, a farmer can scan the exact moment a food is planted, harvested, packaged and distributed, onto the blockchain platform. This comes in handy when there's a food recall because a company can quickly pinpoint where things went wrong. This leads to greater transparency and trust among businesses and consumers, explains Dillenberger.
In fact, it's this social justice aspect that makes blockchain development so appealing to her. Dillenberger points to the 2008 Chinese milk scandal , in which six infants died because plastic was added to baby formulas and milk. She says that tracking food production through blockchain would help companies and the public avoid these types of scenarios.
""I'm an IBM Fellow,"" she adds. ""I'm expected to push the boundaries of the frontiers of science and math and technology.""
Lack of women in blockchain However, most women are not given this opportunity. An analysis of the top 50 blockchain companies found that just 16 percent are founded by and/or led by women.
The reasons behind the gender disparity are varied, but women overwhelmingly point to a ""blockchain bro"" culture that caters exclusively to men. In January, the North American Bitcoin Conference featured 84 male speakers and three women, while the post-conference networking party was held at a Miami strip club . And this isn't a one-off, according to Tavonia Evans, creator of a token coin built on ethereum blockchain technology called $Guap .
Evans tells CNBC Make It that this blockchain bro culture further alienates women in tech and admits that she's skipped blockchain conferences due to a lack of female representation
""There's a level of intimidation in getting into this space,"" says Evans. ""Women like myself have to work harder to create an entryway to get in.""
Why diverse leadership is so crucial Since blockchain is still a relatively new technology, it gives businesses the opportunity to diversify their rankings from the beginning. Frans Johansson, diversity expert and author of the ""Medici Effect,"" notes that this is a crucial step if a company wants to be innovative.
show chapters This is how much education you need to land a job at the world's biggest tech companies      1:26 PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 | 00:56 ""You're at a competitive disadvantage if you're not diverse,"" he tells CNBC Make It . ""So those that push for it early on will succeed much more quickly."" IBM has had a long history of innovation, he says, due to its longstanding diversity efforts that stem back to the '90s. ""Diverse teams can make things happen faster and with less resources,"" adds Johansson.
The 'bro' culture is changing Although various reports highlight this gender imbalance in blockchain , Dillenberger notes that she has personally never experienced a blockchain bro culture. However, she says that she was lucky enough to have parents who fostered a love for STEM at a young age and to have worked with ""powerful"" women in the tech industry.
""My first mentor, my first leader at IBM, was a female and she was gifted,"" recalls Dillenberger. ""My second was a leader that everyone looked up to, not just females.""
IBM's senior vice president of blockchain says as much. Though there is still much more work that needs to be done within the tech space, Kralingen says that the blockchain's gender divide has narrowed. At J.P. Morgan Chase , the bank's blockchain development team is led by Amber Baldet and at Accenture , Iliana Valiente leads the consulting firm's global blockchain innovation division .
Kralingen adds that she strongly believes the appointment of women to leadership roles will continue as more and more women become pioneers in the blockchain industry. ""I'm very, very confident of that,"" she says.

959,6 ways to set goals that actually make you succeed,"6 ways to set goals that actually make you succeed The Oracles CNBC.com Mary Delaney | The Oracles 
Goals are essential for success. But not all goals are created equal. Entrepreneurs and members of The Oracles share their top tips for setting goals that fast-track success in business and life. 1. Match the ""why"" with ""what"" 
Stop listing goals that seem like a good idea. To transform your success trajectory (which leads to greater happiness and fulfillment), take considerable time to ensure that your goals are aligned with your ethos and connected to your mission. 
""Ethos"" is a Greek word describing the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community. Since no goal is achieved solo, ensure that your goals align with the character traits you and your team aim to embody. 
One of the ethos traits of U.S. Navy SEALs is to ""be ready to lead, ready to follow, and never quit."" Therefore, one of my personal goals was to develop greater leadership capacity through ever-challenging positions and situations. I was supported by a team who each had the imperative to develop their leadership and followership skills. So, ask yourself: Does your ethos align with your goal? Do you even know your ethos? 
Although your ethos defines the ""why"" behind what you do, the mission is ""what"" you intend to do. A SEAL's mission is to continuously earn the right to wear the SEAL Trident, capable of defeating our enemies in the most demanding situations, whenever asked. It's no surprise then, that my goal of developing leadership capacity as a SEAL got the right focus and energy, unlike many goals that tend to slip away. 
If a goal aligns with your ethos and connects to your overall mission, the process of fulfilling it will be transformative. It will make you happier too, because you won't quit! — Mark Divine , retired U.S. Navy SEAL commander, founder of SEALFIT , and NYT/WSJ bestselling author ; follow SEALFIT on YouTube , Facebook , or Instagram 2. Grade your goals 
We live in a world where everyone is obsessed with squeezing more goals onto their to-do list. I like to ignore what's on my to-do list for a while and see how I feel about the items on it a few weeks later. 
If a goal still rings true, I give it an ""A"" rating and make sure it gets done. By focusing on the important ""A"" priorities rather than getting distracted by a very long laundry list, chances are that you'll be more fulfilled and effective. — Barbara Corcoran , founder of The Corcoran Group and Shark on "" Shark Tank "" 3. Start with the end in mind 
The making of all Hollywood movies starts with the last scene. In fact, directors often shoot the final scene first. That's what you must do for your life and business. Create an image of who you are, and have your last scene written. Then, work backward with a three-year, five-year or even seven-year plan to get there. Commit to that plan with disciplined routines. 
Part of my daily routine is reading and exercise. I do 100 step-ups, sit-ups, and push-ups every morning. While I do this, I read a ""goal card"" that keeps me focused. When putting your overall plan into action, keep your end in mind. — Roy McDonald , founder and CEO of OneLife 4. Prioritize time-sensitive goals first 
In real estate, as in most business, learning to effectively manage time is a game changer. Create a list of priorities, and focus on what needs to get done right away. Once you've met the urgent needs first, tackle the rest. If there are things on your list you don't want to do, delegate. Don't let them hold you back from doing what you love to do. 
Be cautious of letting things fall through the cracks, though, because if you do, inevitably, they'll carry over to your next week's ""to-do list."" We all have the same number of hours in the day to work with. Make yours work for you. — Dottie Herman , CEO of Douglas Elliman , a real estate brokerage empire with more than $27 billion in annual sales 5. Write out your goals five times a day 
For the past 12 years, I've written my goals five times a day, every day: once when waking up, three times during my day, and once before bed. I created a Facebook goal-writing community, where 600 members do the same. From experience, goal writing is one of the most important tasks to do in your day. 
Just writing your goals creates a relationship with your mind to bring them to life that would otherwise never be understood. It keeps your mind focused on practical ways to progress. It builds your ability to seize opportunities related to your goals. 
If you're facing challenges, try writing out your goals for 30 minutes to one hour. Re-anchoring your mind during any difficulty reminds you of your purpose and can do wonders for your mood and attitude toward success. 
Moving forward, write your goals out three to five times a day at different times, even just for 30 seconds. Practice builds progress. Commit to writing them as a daily lifestyle habit, not a chore. 
Set alarms on your mobile devices.

6427,"Elon Musk defends his strange conference call performance, says analysts were trying to 'justify their Tesla short thesis'","Tesla chief executive Elon Musk took to Twitter early Friday to defend his peculiar behavior on an earnings conference call that caused shares of the electric car maker to lose more than 5 percent.
""The 'dry' questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis,"" Musk tweeted. ""They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.""
Tweet
Musk, in a Twitter rant that followed later Friday morning, promised those betting against Tesla would regret it.

Tesla shares gained 1.3 percent Friday, a day after sliding 6 percent.
On Wednesday evening's conference call, in response to a question about capital requirements from Sanford Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi, Musk said , ""Boring, bonehead questions are not cool, Next?""
show chapters 5 outrageous Elon Musk moments from the bizarre Tesla call 17 Hours Ago | 02:21 In response to a question by RBC's Joseph Spak on the call about Model 3 reservations, Musk said, ""We're going to go to YouTube. Sorry. These questions are so dry. They're killing me.""
Despite Musk's characterization of Sacconaghi and Spak as short sellers, the two have hold ratings on Tesla's stock.
He then took several questions from Galileo Russell, a 25-year-old retail investor and owner of a YouTube Channel who asked Musk on Twitter if he could be on the earnings call, which is normally reserved for analysts, professional investors and sometimes, the media.
His failure to address questions from the analysts about Tesla's finances helped push the stock down 5.6 percent on Thursday. Analysts and investors said the performance hurt their confidence in Musk as the company's leader. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said it was the most unusual call he's experienced in 20 years.
Sacconaghi blasted Musk on Thursday on CNBC, saying , ""This is a financial analyst call, this is not a TED talk.""
Musk continued on Twitter to argue with critics about his performance and defend his failure to answer questions from most of the analysts on the call.
The CEO in the middle of these tweets, acknowledged he shouldn't have dismissed the analysts.
""And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them,"" he tweeted.
Musk begin a thread as to why the analyst questions were not ""valid.""

225,Amazon insists on a new factor for cities still in HQ2 headquarters race: Secrecy,"18 Hours Ago › 
The already heated battle for the coveted Amazon HQ2 project has been a public relations win for the tech giant. But now Amazon is asking the North American cities among the finalists to use a tactic more often associated with Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos: Secrecy. CNBC's Scott Cohn confirmed on Thursday that Amazon has insisted cities shift to a confidential pitch mode as the second round progresses. 
At stake: a $5 billion facility that will employ 50,000 and boost state coffers by adding billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community over the next 10 to 15 years. 
Mayors across North America are choosing their words carefully. 
""It's like a poker game,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNBC at the United States Conference of Mayors on Thursday, explaining that it's time for cities to play their cards close to the vest. ""Bring the bidding war on,"" he said. 
Just not in public. 
The full list of 20 finalists includes some of the most competitive cities in the world and data compiled by CNBC bears that out. 
""We aren't gonna really talk about what's on the table,"" said Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Browser. 
""It's a very secretive process. We're obviously bound by confidentiality,"" said Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. 
""If I were to lay out out now what we'll offer it would be criticized and looked at, and determined whether it's good or bad,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. But Philly's mayor did provide a little color. ""We have people saying we don't want Amazon because housing prices will go up or it will be too crowded. These are problems we'd love to manage."" Getty Images Jeff Bezos 
The trash talking may be over, but some of the incentives already offered are eye-opening: $7 billion from New Jersey (where Newark is a finalist), and potentially $5 billion from Maryland. 
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said it was too early to discuss incentives because Amazon has not yet made clear its expectations. 
Some mayors were more willing than others to give limited pitches in response to CNBC questions at the annual mayors conference. 
Dallas Mayor Rawlings was one. Among his points: 
Dallas has been growing faster than any city in the country and fast growth is a factor that both it and Amazon share. ""Nobody has grown faster or created more jobs than us,"" he said. 
Rawlings also attempted to dispel a few myths. While Austin gets all the tech credit, Dallas has more tech employees — almost as many as in Seattle. And while Rawlings acknowledged the broader Texas ""red state"" reputation is an issue, especially given the tech industry's focus on social tolerance, he stressed that Dallas is ""a blue city in a red state,"" which has scored 100 on the LGBT Index for the past three years. ""There are concerns at the state level, but we are working through that,"" he said. 
Dallas seems to think a factor that has often helped its state in CNBC's Annual Top States for Business ranking will help here too: it will be less expensive for Amazon on multiple fronts. Cheaper to build, lower cost of business, and lower cost of living, Rawlings said. And he made that pitch to Amazon shareholders. 
""Shareholders will win,"" Rawlings said. 
He also highlighted Dallas central placement in the country allowing roundtrip flights to both coasts. And the real winner is ... 
Some outside observers insist that whether shouting from the hills or keeping as quiet as possible, cities aren't going to end up as the real winner. 
""Amazon has algorithms and crawlers that go out and find the lowest prices and create this giant sucking sound, and they've taken it offline and effectively created a transfer in value from taxpayers to Amazon,"" said Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business told CNBC on Thursday. ""It's a 'Hunger Games' environment to mature the best term sheet possible and ask a mayor to match, which will be irresistible,"" Galloway said. He added, ""Amazon is genius in occupying the front page, but this is, simply put, an incredibly deft calculation to extract several pounds of flesh."" 
Many of the finalists were thought to be contenders from the start. They include cities CNBC has already visited as we evaluate the bids: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Denver. But three dark horse candidates joined the list: Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Toronto. The list includes three locations in and around the nation's capital: Washington, D.C.; the Northern Virginia suburbs, and Montgomery County, Maryland. The area was already receiving buzz based on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post. 
One important aspect of the secretive process that not even any of the mayors seem to understand: How long the decision will take for Amazon to make, and whether there will be another round of cuts before the winner is named. Mayors told CNBC's Scott Cohn at the conference that the decision could come by spring or not before next year. And while there are some expectations the list will get whittled down further, mayors don't know if that will be another round in the public process, or if the next words from Amazon will be, ""And the winner is ...""

6170,Trump says he'll announce his decision on Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday afternoon,"President Donald Trump announced in a tweet on Monday that he will deliver his decision on the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET.
@realDonaldTrump: I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.
Trump faces a May 12 deadline to either continue suspending sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports or snap the penalties back into place. Refusing to grant the sanctions relief would imperil the nuclear agreement and potentially put the United States on a diplomatic collision course with some of its closest allies and trade partners.
Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, the international community agreed to continue suspending sanctions against Iran so long as it lives up to the terms of the accord. In exchange for sanctions Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program and grant access to atomic facilities to international inspectors.
While Iran remains in compliance, Trump has threatened to scrap the accord anyway. In January, he said he would no longer waive sanctions unless his administration can reach a deal with European partners to toughen the terms of the 2015 accord.
Despite recent meetings with foreign leaders, that deal has not yet emerged.

5895,San Diego County votes to challenge California's 'sanctuary state' law,"San Diego County's Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to join the U.S. Department of Justice's legal challenge of California's so-called sanctuary policies aimed at protecting undocumented immigrants.
In a 3-1 vote, supervisors for San Diego — home to more than 3.3 million residents — voted to direct the county counsel to file a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Trump administration's lawsuit against California's sanctuary law.
Board Chair Kristin Gaspar, who was one of the three supervisors voting to file the amicus brief, said the board received hundreds emails in support of the move. Gaspar tweeted Tuesday: ""Enough is enough! Governor Jerry Brown needs to follow the laws of our Constitution.""
However, the supervisor who voted against challenging the California sanctuary law issued a statement criticizing the move.
""This is a very divisive issue in the county, and across the state and nation,"" said Supervisor Greg Cox. ""The county joining the lawsuit between the federal and state governments is unnecessary because this is an issue that is properly going to be addressed by the federal courts.""
San Diego County's action follows neighboring Orange County voting last month to issue a restraining order against the state to halt enforcement of the law. Orange County is California's third-most populous county while San Diego County ranks second after Los Angeles.
The fight against the state legislation highlights how some communities in the state are growing weary of the sanctuary law, or state Senate Bill 54 , which bars state and local law enforcement officers from asking about the immigration status of people during routine interactions or participating in federal enforcement actions.
Critics of the state sanctuary law say it jeopardizes public safety and puts law enforcement officers in the state in a tough spot. They also say it can increase the danger down the line for federal immigration agents.
Previously, four other counties in the Golden State — Tehama, Kern, Siskiyou and Shasta — previously passed non-sanctuary resolutions.
Also, the city council of Los Alamitos, a small city in Orange County, on Monday gave final approval to opt out of the sanctuary law , and several other cities in California are considering taking similar actions.
Dubbed the ""California Values Act,"" SB 54 bars local jails from detaining undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime past their normal release time at the request of federal agents.
Some local law enforcement officials also complain it puts restrictions on their ability to communicate concerns with federal law enforcement authorities about certain undocumented offenders being released on the street.
The case against California is being heard in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California in Sacramento.
In filing the original lawsuit March 6 , the Justice Department also included an accompanying motion for preliminary injunction that could be decided in a matter of months, according to legal experts. Legal experts say the side that ultimately loses will get the ability to file an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, even as the rest of the case moves forward with the lower District Court. There's also a possibility the case could ultimately find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court and then take years to resolve.
In all, the U.S. government's suit against the state of California centers on three laws — all of which the Trump administration claims ""intentionally obstruct and discriminate against the enforcement of federal immigration law.""

Gox sold roughly $400 million worth of the digital currency to pay off creditors, according to documents published last week. The remaining liquidation reportedly won't happen until September, which some analysts say is helping sentiment. ""It's still hanging over but now we've got six months or so before that's an issue,"" says Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM. ""In terms of the Tokyo Whale, it's a supply issue, but it's also a sentiment issue."" CNBC.com SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrian look at monitor showing the prices of virtual currencies at the Bithumb exchange office in Seoul, South Korea, on Friday, Dec. 15, 2017. 
News that an influential bitcoin holder is taking a break from selling has added to a bullish case for the digital currency. 
A trustee of defunct Tokyo bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox sold more than 35,000 bitcoin, worth about $400 million at the time, to pay off creditors, according to details of the sale published by a company trustee last week. 
The exchange closed in 2014 and filed for bankruptcy after the theft of 850,000 bitcoin. In order to liquidate Mt. Gox's remaining 166,000 bitcoin, worth about $1.6 billion at Monday's prices, lawyer and trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi said he still needs regulatory approval. 
Some reports and Twitter users said the next court hearing is not until September 2018. 
""It's still hanging over but now we've got six months or so before that's an issue,"" Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM, told CNBC Monday. ""In terms of the Tokyo Whale it's a supply issue, but it's also a sentiment issue."" TWEET 
Bitcoin prices briefly recovered into this week. The digital currency rose 6.96 percent from Friday's close to a high of $9,885.22 Monday, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index. Prices later fell to $9,241.17 as of 12:40 p.m. ET Monday. 
Bitcoin fell below $10,000 and shed nearly 18 percent of its value over two days last week following increased regulatory scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges last week.

In order to pay back creditors, Kobayashi has sold 35,841 Bitcoin and 34,008 Bitcoin cash on behalf of the company since September of last year. This flood of bitcoin could have contributed to recent downward pressure, Kelly said. 
""It's down 70 percent from top but at some point you run out of sellers,"" Kelly said. ""It looks as though the market's trying to bottom out."" 
While the Mt. Gox selling appears to be on hold, bitcoin faces other roadblocks. 
News of compromised accounts on a major Hong Kong-based exchange, a statement from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expanded its scrutiny to cryptocurrency exchanges, and more news from Japanese regulators also added to investor worries last week. 
""This is just one factor that's impacting bitcoin at this point,"" Jack Tatar, managing partner at Doyle Capital Management said. 
Some Chicago Board of Exchange, or Cboe, bitcoin futures contracts expire Wednesday, which Tatar said could be adding to bitcoin's downward price moves Monday.

1693,"'Shutdown coming?' All eyes are on divided Senate, Trump as deadline threatens","6 Hours Ago | 02:07 
President Donald Trump urged Senate Democrats to get behind a short-term spending bill Friday morning as the deadline for funding the government loomed only hours away. 
Trump's tweet came ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate on a stopgap spending measure that passed the House on Thursday night . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell maneuvered to make sure the vote takes place Friday, rather than late Thursday, to put as much pressure as possible on Democrats who appeared set to sink the bill and restart negotiations to keep the government open. 
Some government agencies will run out of money if Congress cannot pass a funding plan by the end of Friday. 
""Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate – but they want illegal immigration and weak borders,"" Trump contended in a tweet. 
""Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!"" he added. Trump tweet 
Goldman Sachs economic analysts said Friday they see a 60 percent chance of a shutdown lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Each week of a shutdown would reduce first quarter gross domestic product by 0.2 percentage points, the analysts said in a note, although the impact would be reversed in the second quarter. 
The legislation before the Senate would fund the government through Feb. 16, reauthorize the popular Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and delay some Affordable Care Act taxes. The GOP included reauthorization of CHIP — a program popular with Democrats — in the spending plan largely to force the minority party to support it. 
The bill passed in the House with only some Republicans voting against it and a few Democrats supporting it. However, it will need at least 10 Democratic votes to clear the Senate — and possibly more if the three Republicans who oppose it continue to hold out. Zach Gibson | Bloomberg | Getty Images Demonstrators hold illuminated signs during a rally supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), or the Dream Act, outside the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Jan. 18, 2018. 
On Friday morning, McConnell contended that voting for the bill should be a ""no-brainer"" and hit Schumer for putting his members ""into a corner"" over immigration. Shortly after 11 a.m., he said the Senate would move to a procedural vote on the measure ""soon."" 
After it appeared House Republicans could adjourn on Friday as scheduled, members said they were told to stick around for possible additional votes. If the Senate rejects the House-passed proposed, lawmakers could have to scramble for an alternative. 
Saturday is the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration. He was scheduled to leave Washington on Friday for his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he was slated to celebrate his first year in office with a big-money fundraiser . 
However, the White House later said Trump will not go to Florida on Friday as the shutdown deadline loomed. 
Democrats have cried foul over Republicans moving to pass a spending bill this week without also trying to pass immigration legislation. The minority party wants to approve a measure shielding hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation, along with Republican-sought measures to boost border security and reform extended family migration and the visa ""lottery"" system. 
After Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting to proceed to the House-passed spending bill Thursday night, progress stalled as lawmakers were faced with the prospect of the plan failing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted to hold the doomed vote on Thursday night. That may have set the stage for fresh talks on funding the government on Friday, and Schumer argued that lawmakers had enough time to put an immigration deal in front of the president. 
McConnell ensured that a vote on the plan would not take place until Friday, thereby putting more pressure on Democrats to pass it or risk a shutdown. 
On the Senate floor Thursday night, McConnell said Democrats were trying to hold the country ""hostage"" over a ""non-imminent problem."" 
Schumer, in response, decried ""complete disarray"" on the Republican side. He argued for a bill that extended funding only for a few days, rather than a month, to give lawmakers more time to hash out a long-term plan. show chapters",2018-01-19T15:12:00.000+02:00

1045,Trump is likely to keep Iran deal in place — for now. Here's what could happen if he doesn't,"President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week whether the U.S. will remain committed to the Iran nuclear pact, the abandonment of which could trigger a diplomatic crisis and jolt oil markets.
Sources close to the administration cited by the Associated Press predict that Trump will leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in place for the time being and waive nuclear sanctions on the Islamic republic as he did on October 13, despite his well-known opposition to the agreement. During his campaign, Trump promised to dump it, calling the it ""the worst deal ever.""
The JCPOA, enacted in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany, allowed the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in exchange for compliance with restrictions on its nuclear program. Between January 12 and 17, sanctions on foreign oil purchases, insurance, shipping, banking, and oil and gas investment are due for waiver.
Oil markets at risk Any U.S. disruption to the deal could shake oil markets, according to a report by Citigroup's global commodities team published Tuesday. A snap-back on sanctions would cause the ""dislocation of at least 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian crude oil exports, especially those going to Korea and Japan as well as to some European countries.""
show chapters Iran and Venezuela present biggest risk to oil in 2018: ClearView Energy Partners      8:13 AM ET Wed, 10 Jan 2018 | 03:35 This would trigger an initial $5 per barrel rise in crude oil prices, Citi wrote, ""as customers losing oil under U.S. pressure scramble for replacements at a time when OPEC and other producers have put a lid on their output.""
In October, Trump left the deal's fate to Congress after refusing to certify Iran's compliance, despite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reporting in November that the country was ""operating within the essential limits on its nuclear activities"" imposed by the JCPOA. The U.S. president is required to recertify Iran's compliance to its terms once every 90 days.
This time around, Trump is likely to concede that Iran is complying with the deal but that it's not in the U.S.'s national security interest, said Richard Nephew, a former coordinator for sanctions policy at the U.S. State Department and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Congress then has a following 60 days to either re-impose sanctions on Iran or do nothing.
Non-nuclear sanctions ""The only real outstanding question is what Donald Trump thinks and will choose to do. Contacts within his administration ... have reported that the decision is effectively a 'coin flip' now,"" Nephew wrote in a commentary for Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy on Tuesday. Voices in both Congress and the national security establishment have been urging the president to safeguard the deal, according to several reports, although new non-nuclear sanctions appear likely.
show chapters Iran and Saudi Arabia are going through a 'parallel' process. Here's why: NYT's Tom Friedman      7:40 AM ET Tue, 9 Jan 2018 | 03:32 ""Any deal that comes out of Congress is likely to include tougher sanctions or other punitive measures against Iran given bipartisan support for such measures,"" Ryan Turner, lead risk analyst at Protection Group International, told CNBC on Wednesday. However, he noted, the U.S. is only one of six international signatories to the deal. ""Lawmakers can amend the domestic legislation but cannot change the deal itself without the backing of other parties, which is unlikely to materialize.""
New sanctions would likely be aimed both at Iran's missile program and its activities in the region, despite opposition from other deal signatories, the Citi report said. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Shia militant group Hezbollah, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, are the predominant targets.
""The not-so-subtle threat is one that could materialize in a worst case scenario, which could see Iran use Trump's decision as justification to pull out of the agreement and restart its nuclear program."" -Ryan Turner, lead risk analyst at Protection Group International ""Although too small to directly impact the economy, [the sanctions] will serve to further damage much needed investor sentiment towards Iran,"" Pat Thaker, regional director for the Middle East and Africa at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday. Iran remains mired in deficit, and while the country's economy grew more than 7 percent in the year following the JCPOA's enactment, foreign investment flows are far from reaching government targets.
Thaker expects the state to bunker down and financial sector reform ""to go into reverse"" in the event of an abrogation of the deal. Still, she said, ""I expect the nuclear deal to largely remain intact, with the U.S. instead focusing on increasing non-nuclear sanctions.""
Potential for backfire International bodies are urging the president to tread carefully, as moves to punish Iran could backfire. Iran's Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that ""a reimposition of sanctions by the United States would be a violation of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers,"" and that Iran could greatly increase its enrichment of uranium, according to Reuters.

The foreign ministers of Germany, France and the U.K. on Thursday issued statements urging the U.S. to remain faithful to the JCPOA, insisting that the agreement was essential to international security. Federica Mogherini, the EU's top diplomat, said that it ""made the world safer and prevented a potential nuclear arms race in the region.""
Still, opponents of the deal argue that a continued suspension of sanctions would only reward a regime that has ramped up its missile testing in recent months and continues to violate human rights. Thousands of Iranians have been arrested at the hands of security forces following more than a week of anti-government protests all over the country, and at least 21 have died. The protests introduce an unexpected dynamic to the Trump administration's deliberations, providing a potential excuse to re-impose sanctions.

The report in the Willamette Week in Portland, Oregon, came two weeks after a Sports Illustrated account that portrayed a hostile work environment for women in the front office of the Mavericks. 
The woman claimed Cuban reached inside her pants and penetrated her vagina with his finger while they were taking a picture in a Portland nightclub. In an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Cuban wrote, ""It didn't happen."" 
In a report explaining why they weren't pursuing the case, prosecutors wrote that ""there is no evidence to corroborate the complainant's statement and there is evidence contradicting the claim."" The report also said the woman didn't want to proceed with the allegation. 
The SI report included claims of inappropriate sexual conduct by former CEO Terdema Ussery and raised questions about what Cuban knew and when.

Redfield's salary was much higher than his predecessors. The New York Times reported that Redfield made a higher salary figure than his boss, HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Tracey Brown | University of Maryland School of Medicine via AP Dr. Robert Redfield
The Centers for Disease Control will cut its director's $375,000 salary, following a raft of complaints and media reports that he was being paid much more than his predecessors.
The director, Dr. Robert Redfield, enjoyed a significantly higher salary than his predecessor, Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, whose was paid $197,300 a year, the New York Times reported Monday .
Redfield was able to secure the higher pay through a provision allowing more lucrative salary packages to lure scientists with specialized skill sets, the Times reported.
The HIV/AIDS researcher was reportedly paid more than his boss, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who earns less than $200,000 a year.
Dr. Redfield told Secretary Azar that he didn't want his compensation to become a distraction, a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services told CNBC. ""Therefore, consistent with Dr. Redfield's request, his compensation will be adjusted accordingly,"" the spokeswoman said.
Fitzgerald, who was an OBGYN before accepting the role of CDC director, apparently did not make use of the special salary dispensation.
Numerous Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups had filed complaints and inquiries about Redfield's salary, news outlets have reported.
Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS, told CNBC in a statement that Redfield's appointment was ""a rare opportunity to hire one of the world's leading virologists.""
""The selection of Dr. Redfield was the right choice at the right time for the right purpose.

Regular check ups can save your life , but they don't necessarily require you to go to the doctor. You can also receive effective incremental care at a place like your barbershop.
In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, African-American men in Los Angeles went to their local barbers and, with the help of a pharmacist right there in the shop, effectively lowered their high blood pressure, decreasing their risk for heart disease, the No. 1 killer of men in the U.S.
What's more, doctors were hardly involved.
""High blood pressure disproportionately affects the African-American community, and we must find new ways to reach out so we can prevent strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and early deaths,"" said Ronald G. Victor, MD, associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and lead author, in a press release . show chapters 9:30 AM ET Tue, 8 Aug 2017 | 00:58
In one of Victor's previous experiments years ago, he had barbers refer patrons with high blood pressure to physicians, but the intervention was only minimally successful in improving health, according to The New York Times .
For the more recent study, while the control group was encouraged by their barbers to make healthy lifestyle changes and go see physicians, members of the intervention group were encouraged to meet with pharmacists right there in the barbershop. On a monthly basis, the pharmacists performed blood tests and prescribed medication, all while keeping each patron's primary care provider in the loop.
The result: While the control group lowered systolic blood pressure from an average of 155 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) to 145 after six months, the intervention group dropped from 153 to 126. Only 11 percent of the control group patrons brought their blood pressure to a healthy range, but two-thirds of those who worked with pharmacists in the barber shop were successful.
""It woke me up. All I could think about was me having a stroke and not being here for [my son]. It was time to get my health right,"" Marc Sims, a 43-year-old records clerk at a law firm, told the Associated Press . show chapters 12:55 PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 | 01:01
Medical care in the U.S. is notoriously expensive , costing the average America $10,000 in 2016, and many can't afford it. About one out of four Americans say they or someone in their family have skipped necessary care because of the cost, according to a Bankrate survey, while most can't cover a $1,000 emergency . Millions wait until they get a tax refund to access care they've been putting off.
And though blood pressure medication has become more affordable than it used to be, costs , as well as distrust in the health care system, have prevented much of the high-risk population highlighted in this study from receiving ongoing care necessary to treat hypertension, a chronic condition.
""Once you have hypertension, it requires a lifetime commitment to taking medications and making lifestyle changes,"" Victor said. ""It is often challenging to get people who need blood pressure medication to take them ... With this program, we have been able to overcome that barrier.""
Researchers also believe the participants of the study were more receptive to support and advice when it came to them in a familiar, convenient place.
""There is a different level of trust and respect that's earned when you meet people where they are, instead of in a hospital or clinic,"" said Ciantel Blyler, a pharmacist at one of the barbershops and co-author of the study. ""The rapport I've been able to establish with this group of patients has been unlike any other I've had in my professional career.""

4735,Ford will reportedly roll out new Lincoln models in China by 2022,"Retail Report Ford will reportedly roll out new Lincoln models in China by 2022 Ford Motor's premium Lincoln brand plans to build as many as five new vehicles in China by 2022, according to two U.S. sources, in a move to expand sales in the world's largest vehicle market that would also blunt the impact of U.S-China trade spats. All Lincoln vehicles that Ford now sells in China are brought in from North America. Published 15 Hours Ago Reuters VCG | Getty Images A Lincoln Navigator concept vehicle is on display during the 17th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition at the National Exhibition and Convention Center on April 23, 2017 in Shanghai, China. 
Ford Motor's premium Lincoln brand plans to build as many as five new vehicles in China by 2022, according to two U.S. sources, in a move to expand sales in the world's largest vehicle market that would also blunt the impact of trade U.S-China trade spats. 
Ford has said it plans to build an all-new sport utility vehicle in China by the end of 2019, however the company has not detailed future production plans for the Lincoln brand in China beyond that. 
""Our localization plans to support the China market are on track and will serve to further drive Lincoln's growth in China,"" Lincoln spokeswoman Angie Kozleski said. ""Beyond that, it would be premature to discuss our future product and production plans or timing."" 
Sources familiar with Ford's production plans told Reuters the automaker now expects to begin building the new Lincoln Aviator in China in late 2019 or early 2020, along with replacements for the MKC compact crossover and the MKZ midsize sedan, followed in 2021 by the all-new Nautilus, which replaces the Lincoln MKX crossover. 
A fifth model, a small coupe-like crossover, is tentatively slated for production in China in 2022, the sources said. 
Ford has much to lose if the war of words over trade between China and U.S. President Donald Trump escalates into a full-blown tariff war. Last year, it shipped about 80,000 vehicles to China from North America, more than half of them Lincolns to support the brand's growth. 
All Lincoln vehicles that Ford now sells in China are brought in from North America . 
Even if China does reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles — as Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Tuesday — it is not clear that would mean a big, long-term increase in Fords and Lincolns made in U.S. factories heading to Chinese showrooms. 
Ford is pursuing long-range plans to build more vehicles in China to serve a market that is now roughly 60 percent larger than the U.S. market, and projected to keep growing. But it is playing catch up to hometown rival General Motors and German luxury brands including Audi , BMW and Mercedes-Benz , which have invested heavily in Chinese production in recent years as a form of insurance against trade, political and currency gyrations and to lower price points for their premium cars. 
Chinese vehicle imports from all markets last year climbed to 1.2 million, but still represent less than 5 percent of total vehicle sales in the country, according to figures from the China Automobile Dealers Association. Less than a quarter of the imported vehicles sold in China - 267,473, according to Statista — came from U.S. auto plants. 
The current 25-percent tariff rate makes it tough for Ford's American premium brand to compete with GM's Cadillac and the Germans, which avoid the import tariff on their locally built vehicles. 
""As long as Lincolns are not manufactured in China, the brand's sales will no doubt suffer continuously,"" Zhu Kongyuan, Secretary General of the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce (CADCC), told Reuters. Slower start in China 
The Lincoln brand launched in China four years ago, and local production of the first Lincoln brand vehicles will not start for another 18-24 months, people familiar with the company's plans said. 
The entire localization process could take Ford as long as four years. 
All five Lincoln models are expected to offer hybrid gasoline-electric variants, to help Ford meet China's tough new quotas for electrified vehicles, the sources said. 
While it sold 54,124 vehicles in China last year — a record for the brand — Lincoln continues to trail Cadillac and the German luxury brands by a wide margin in that market. 
Cadillac — which GM launched in China in 2004 — builds in China virtually all of the vehicles it sells there and thus avoids the steep import duty. Cadillac outsold Lincoln by more than three-to-one in China last year, selling a total of 175,489 vehicles though a network of roughly 180 retail stores. 
China is Cadillac's largest market. 
If Beijing follows through on its threat to double import tariffs before Lincoln can ramp up local production, the resulting price hikes on its imported models could persuade many people to buy a Cadillac or a Lexus instead, said CADCC's Zhu. Related Securities",2018-04-12T04:49:00.000+03:00

Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan told employees in an internal memo Thursday that ""yesterday was not a good day"" for the company, after the pharmaceutical giant revealed that it paid $1.2 million to President Donald Trump 's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen .
Narasimhan said ""we made a mistake"" in entering a contract in February 2017 with Cohen through his company, Essential Consultants, for guidance ""as to how the Trump administration might approach certain US healthcare policy matters.""
""As a consequence, [we] are being criticized by a world that expects more from us,"" Narasimhan said in the internal email, which was obtained by CNBC.
The CEO's message was first reported by health-care news outlet STAT .
In a statement Wednesday, Novartis said that the one-year agreement, for which Essential Consultants was paid $100,000 per month, ""predated Vas Narasimhan becoming Novartis CEO and he was in no way involved with this agreement.""
Novartis also said in the statement that it had been contacted by special counsel Robert Mueller 's office in November 2017 regarding the agreement.
Payments from Novartis to Cohen's company were first alleged in an explosive report from lawyer Michael Avenatti, whose client, porn star Stormy Daniels , is suing Trump and Cohen to void a nondisclosure deal that bars her from discussing an alleged affair.
Avenatti's report claimed Novartis had paid Essential Consultants nearly $400,000; in the Wednesday statement, Novartis revealed that it had paid $1.2 million to Cohen's company .

""Dear Colleagues,
Yesterday was not a good day for Novartis. Many of you will have seen media reports regarding Novartis' relationship with Essential Consultants in the United States and many of you will feel disappointed and frustrated. You can read our full statement here. We made a mistake in entering into this engagement and, as a consequence, are being criticized by a world that expects more from us.
Personally and for my family, it was also a difficult day, as unfounded stories spread through the US news. While I was not involved with any aspect of this situation, the facts did not matter. I went to sleep frustrated and tired.

1218,"US crude's price is catching up to the rest of the world, creating a risk to the export boom","U.S. crude's significant discount to international oil prices has been a major factor in booming American exports, but the price difference has narrowed this month, setting up a potential risk to the overseas shipments.
The price difference between Brent crude , the international benchmark for oil prices, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate has shrunk by about 40 percent in January to its narrowest in five months. It now stands at roughly $4 a barrel, down from $7 a month ago.
When Brent trades at a premium to WTI, it encourages foreign buyers to buy U.S. crude.
""Part of the growth in U.S. exports has been this arbitrage,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital.
""We'll have to see at what point does the export picture start to get restrained as a result of the lower spread. Is that $3 or lower?""
The spread blew out in September, when Hurricane Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity along the nation's Gulf Coast refining hub. That reduced demand for crude oil, the main feedstock for making refined fuel such as gasoline, and caused stockpiles to build up.
It was around this time that China started placing orders for big purchases of the discounted U.S. crude, according to tanker-tracking firm ClipperData. Shortly after, the U.S. exported a record 2.13 million barrels a day.
But U.S. crude stockpiles are now drawing down rapidly, falling last week to their lowest level since February 2015, contributing to an 8.5 percent gain for U.S. crude futures this month alone. By comparison, Brent futures are up nearly 4 percent.
show chapters Saudi finance minister: We welcome rising crude prices      5:54 AM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 | 00:39 However, analysts say it's not time to worry about U.S. oil exports falling off a cliff. The shipments remain well supported by regional price differences and other factors.
Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service, notes that $4 a barrel is a level that one would expect the Brent-WTI spread to roughly average over the course of a year. 
Even at $4 a barrel, there's enough buying incentive among foreign purchasers to keep U.S. exports at about a million barrels a day, said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.
""If we start to see those exports dropping off, that will only cause the spread to widen again because production is only going in one direction, which is up,"" he said.
U.S. crude oil production is projected to soon top 10 million barrels a day, a level not seen since the 1970s. At that point U.S. output would top production from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter.
""So the crude is available to be exported,"" Smith said. ""It's just how much depends on how wide the spread is.""
Oil exports have an additional buffer because what truly matters is the price of light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast — where it's typically exported — to international oil prices, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
That Gulf Coast crude trades at a premium to WTI, but that premium has also shrunk recently. The difference between Gulf Coast crude and Brent remains wide enough to keep U.S. exports near record levels, Lipow said.
The biggest driver behind falling U.S. stockpiles is a drop in inventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, a major storage hub and the delivery point for WTI, analysts say.
Those stockpiles are draining more quickly thanks to the opening of the Diamond Pipeline, which carries crude from Cushing to a Valero refinery in Memphis, Tennessee.
That reduces the need to ship Gulf Coast crude north, Lipow noted. Consequently, there might soon be more Gulf Coast crude available for export.

""I think one of the areas which we need to start talking about is also services,"" Rakesh Bharti Mittal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, told CNBC on Monday. ""So far, we've been talking more on trade, on products.""
""India is known for its software power.

Mittal also spoke of India's potential as a hub for cybersecurity, particularly given recent headlines about data privacy. ""A lot of investment will go into this,"" he said.
India's information technology sector is projected to grow to approximately 8 percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year of 2017, said a report by the National Association of Software and Services Companies, an industry body. This is valued at $154 billion.
According to a report by India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the country ""remains the world's top sourcing destination in 2017-18 with a share of about 55 percent.""
But India is more likely to expand its exports globally on a multilateral basis, Mittal said.
""The matter of fact is that regional, bilateral trade agreements are on the backburner. FTAs (free trade agreements) have not resulted in both sides being happy. Someone gains and someone else loses, and that's what we are now seeing globally.""",2018-04-18T14:55:00.000+03:00
5511,"Any GE rebound is nothing more than a ‘dead cat bounce,’ market watcher says","3:23 PM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 02:16 
After its best week in more than a month, General Electric started Monday in the red. To those expecting a more prolonged rebound, think again, says one market watcher. 
""If you're investing in GE right now, you're playing nothing more than a dead cat bounce,"" Michael Binger , senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Friday. 
The industrial giant is in the middle of a multiyear restructuring process that could put a stop to any upward momentum, said Binger. 
""They've outspent their cash flow, they've cut their dividend, they've made ill-timed acquisitions, they've layered on a ton of debt on their balance sheet,"" he said. ""I think this is going to take a lot of time. I don't think it's investable right now."" 
Binger said that a number of divestitures and write-downs could right-size the business, but expects this to be a long process. On top of that, he says the Dow stock is finally paying the price for relying on GE Capital and acquired noncore businesses to help beat earnings estimates each quarter. 
GE said Friday that it will take a charge of $4.24 billion for its first quarter, while profits over the past two years have been revised lower by 30 cents a share. Markets had already expected a restatement of that size. 
Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global, shares a similarly bearish view on the company's growth potential. 
""If you look at GE, you have a struggling transportation business, you have a mediocre power business. I mean, their aerospace servicing business is probably the best business that they have,"" she told CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" 
GE enjoyed a small bounce at the end of last week, one Sanchez credits to hopes it will unload more of its assets. The company announced earlier this month that Veritas Capital has agreed to acquire a health-care technology unit from GE for $1.05 billion in cash. 
Unloading assets might not be enough to fix GE's troubles, though, said Sanchez. 
""I still think there's uncertainty and, quite frankly, I don't think asset dispositions are necessarily going to fix this problem,"" she said. 
Sanchez says the likelihood of another earnings miss and dividend cut could return downward pressure to its stock. GE has missed analysts' expectations over the previous three quarters. The company also last cut its dividend in November, marking the second time it had done so since the Great Depression. 
GE shares were down nearly 1 percent Monday. They closed out last week with gains of more than 3 percent, their best week in more than a month. The stock is on track for its 14 th straight month of losses, its longest such losing streak ever. It remains 23 percent lower for 2018.",2018-04-16T19:31:00.000+03:00

* December marketing down 1.4 pct vs last year 
* Report mildly bearish for CME live cattle futures 
CHICAGO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ranchers sent nearly 1 percent more cattle to U.S. feedlots in December than the same time a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported on Friday. The result topped most analysts' predictions, mainly led by worsening drought in the U.S. southern Plains that shriveled available winter wheat grazing pasture. Corn Belt states were the recipients of cattle from areas of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota where insufficient moisture persists. ""These very dry conditions that are developing in wheat pasture country drove change in placements in November. And I suspect we got some of that in December also,"" said Texas A&M University economist David Anderson. Some analysts cited cheaper feed, which lowered input costs for feedlots, as another reason behind last month's placement uptick. And more heifers are entering feedyards, suggesting to analysts that the rate of cattle herd expansion is slowing. On Monday Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures may open lower following USDA's report, but could quickly rebound spurred by higher-than-expected prices for market-ready, or cash, cattle later on Friday. USDA's report showed December placements at 1.799 million head, up 0.8 percent from 1.785 million a year earlier and exceeded the average forecast of 1.730 million. The government put the feedlot cattle supply as of Jan. 1 at 11.489 million head, up 8.3 percent from 10.605 million a year ago. Analysts, on average, forecast a 7.7 percent rise. USDA said the number of cattle sold to packers, or marketings, were down 1.4 percent in December from a year ago to 1.752 million head. Analysts had projected a 1.2 percent drop from 1.777 million last year. ""The big placement figure tells you that we're going to have big numbers of cattle coming at us for the foreseeable future,"" said U.S. Commodities President Don Roose. He too alluded to the bump in feedlot cattle placements in Corn Belt states where feed is more plentiful. ""You continue to be in a drought in the Southern Plains, that continues to expand, so it no doubt is another factor that you have to throw into the placement discussion,"" said Roose.

7275,Here's everything you need to know about earnings from Macy's,"7 Hours Ago | 02:19
Coming out of a strong holiday season, Macy's is reaping the benefits of healthy consumer spending.
The department store has kept its clearance racks in check and has less stale inventory on the floor. The result: Macy's managed to outpace analysts' first-quarter earnings and sales expectations and raised its full-year outlook.
Its shares closed up more than 10 percent Wednesday, the best day since Dec. 17, 2008, when the stock closed up 10.98 percent. Including Wednesday's gains, Macy's shares have risen more than 30 percent so far this year.
Here's what Macy's reported compared with what analysts were expecting, based on a survey by Thomson Reuters: Earnings per share: 48 cents, adjusted, vs. 37 cents expected Revenue: $5.5 billion vs. $5.4 billion expected Same-store sales: an increased of 4.2 percent vs. an increase of 1.4 percent expected
The company said all three of its divisions — Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury — exceeded expectations during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
The company also saw a boost from international tourism but said it would be ending its joint venture with Fung Retailing Limited in China. Instead, Macy's will remain on Alibaba 's TMall platform and focus its efforts there. The retailer's top markets overseas include China, the United Kingdom and Brazil.
""After a good holiday season, there was a question as to whether Macy's could continue to deliver a recovery,"" said Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail. ""Today's results answer in the affirmative ... suggesting that Macy's recovery is gaining momentum.""
Net income climbed to $139 million, or 45 cents per share, in the period ended May 5, from $78 million, or 26 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Macy's earned 48 cents a share, 11 cents better than what analysts had expected.
Revenues rose roughly 3.6 percent to $5.5 billion, again surpassing analysts' expectations. The company said some of its best-selling categories were fine jewelry and dresses.
Same-store sales on an owned plus licensed basis were up 4.2 percent, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the Street's forecast. Part of the jump can be attributed to the fact that Macy's shifted a friends and family promotional event to the first quarter from the second quarter this year.
The retailer now expects full-year earnings per share to fall within a range of $3.75 to $3.95, 20 cents higher than a prior forecast. Analysts were calling for earnings of $3.61 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.
Total sales in 2018 are predicted by Macy's to climb as much as half a percent. Same-store sales on an owned plus licensed basis could rise as much as 2 percent.
Just last week, Morgan Stanley downgraded Macy's shares, citing declining sales and profit ""pressure"" from online players for the ratings change. A few days earlier, Deutsche Bank said in a note that there's ""limited upside"" for investors in the department store space.
But the results from Macy's on Wednesday paint a better-than-expected picture, and the company said momentum will continue into the latter half of the year. Its online sales increased by a double-digit percentage during the first quarter alone.
Still, many retailers, including Macy's, face the threat of Amazon becoming the nation's No. 1 apparel retailer by the end of 2018.
To combat rivals, the department store chain has been focused on rolling out new concepts in stores, like branded pop-up shops, and expanding its off-price business, Macy's Backstage. In the first quarter alone, Macy's opened about 20 Backstage locations, with plans to open 100 this fiscal year.
Macy's just recently announced its acquisition of Story , a New York-based concept shop, and will be bringing on Story's founder, Rachel Shechtman, as ""brand experience officer"" to steer the company's creative strategy.
Last week, Macy's opened up its loyalty program to all customers. It used to be limited to the chain's credit card holders. The platform allows shoppers to rack up points on purchases that can be redeemed at Macy's stores or online.
The company is also in the midst of rolling out mobile checkout to all of its locations by year's end and is adding a virtual reality shopping experience to some stores.
""Our best customer is responding well to the improvements we've made to her experience in our stores, on .com and through the Macy's app,"" CEO Jeff Gennette said Wednesday in a statement.
The positive results from Macy's set the tone for a slew of other retailers, including J.C. Penney , Kohl's and Nordstrom , which are set to report earnings in the coming days. Those retailers' stocks, among others, all climbed higher Wednesday following the report.

1300,US hockey general manager dies unexpectedly on the eve of the Winter Olympics,"Jim Johannson, the general manager of the U.S. Olympic men's hockey team, has died on the eve of the Pyeongchang Games. He was 53.
Johannson passed away in his sleep Sunday morning, according to USA Hockey. Executive director Pat Kelleher said the organization is ""beyond shocked and profoundly saddened"" by the loss of the Rochester, Minnesota native.
""As accomplished as Jim was in hockey, he was the absolute best, most humble, kind and caring person you could ever hope to meet,"" Kelleher said in a release. ""His impact on our sport and more importantly the people and players in our sport have been immeasurable. Our condolences go out to his entire family, but especially to his loving wife Abby and their young daughter Ellie.""
Johannson's role in selecting this year's Olympic team was his most high-profile job in a career spent in hockey. He also played for the U.S. in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics.
The United States faces Slovenia in its Pyeongchang opener on Feb. 14.
""We lost a true friend in Jim Johannson today,"" said U.S. coach and 1988 teammate Tony Granato said. ""He was so compassionate and as loyal a friend as you could have. He was the ultimate teammate.""
Johannson began working for USA Hockey in 2000 after spending five years as the general manager of the Twin Cities Vulcans in the United States Hockey League. He was promoted to assistant executive director of hockey operations in 2007, overseeing the organization's efforts in fielding teams for international competition.
He played college hockey at Wisconsin and helped the Badgers win the NCAA championship as a freshman. He was selected by Hartford in the seventh round of the 1982 draft, but never played in the NHL.
""When we heard of JJ's passing, we are reminded of what an enjoyable person he was to be around, and also what he meant to USA Hockey and hockey worldwide,"" Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula, who have a strong connection to USA Hockey, said in a release.
""We should all strive to do our jobs and treat people as JJ did. Jim Johannson, you have moved on, but you will not be forgotten. We will miss you.""
Sabres coach Phil Housley, whom Johannson picked to lead the U.S. at the 2015 world juniors and won gold, said the longtime USA Hockey executive was one of the best leaders and ""grew our game to new heights.""",2018-01-22T13:24:00.000+02:00
7206,Security troops on US nuclear missile base took LSD,"One airman said he felt paranoia. Another marveled at the vibrant colors. A third admitted, ""I absolutely just loved altering my mind.""
Meet service members entrusted with guarding nuclear missiles that are among the most powerful in America's arsenal. Air Force records obtained by The Associated Press show they bought, distributed and used the hallucinogen LSD and other mind-altering illegal drugs as part of a ring that operated undetected for months on a highly secure military base in Wyoming. After investigators closed in, one airman deserted to Mexico.
""Although this sounds like something from a movie, it isn't,"" said Capt. Charles Grimsley, the lead prosecutor of one of several courts martial.
show chapters Here's what a land war with North Korea could look like 8:38 AM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 | 02:20 A slip-up on social media by one airman enabled investigators to crack the drug ring at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in March 2016, details of which are reported here for the first time. Fourteen airmen were disciplined. Six of them were convicted in courts martial of LSD use or distribution or both.
None of the airmen was accused of using drugs on duty. Yet it's another blow to the reputation of the Air Force's nuclear missile corps, which is capable of unleashing hell in the form of Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. The corps has struggled at times with misbehavior, mismanagement and low morale.
Although seen by some as a backwater of the U.S. military, the missile force has returned to the spotlight as President Donald Trump has called for strengthening U.S. nuclear firepower and exchanged threats last year with North Korea. The administration's nuclear strategy calls for hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending in coming decades.
The service members accused of involvement in the LSD ring were from the 90th Missile Wing, which operates one-third of the 400 Minuteman 3 missiles that stand ""on alert"" 24/7 in underground silos scattered across the northern Great Plains.
Documents obtained by the AP over the past two years through the Freedom of Information Act tell a sordid tale of off-duty use of LSD, cocaine and other drugs in 2015 and 2016 by airmen who were supposed to be held to strict behavioral standards because of their role in securing the weapons.
""It's another black eye for the Air Force — for the ICBM force in particular,"" says Stephen Schwartz, an independent consultant and nuclear expert.
In response to AP inquiries, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said the drug activity took place during off-duty hours. ""There are multiple checks to ensure airmen who report for duty are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs and are able to execute the mission safely, securely and effectively,"" he said.
Airman 1st Class Tommy N. Ashworth was among those who used LSD supplied by colleagues with connections to civilian drug dealers.
""I felt paranoia, panic"" for hours after taking a hit of acid, Ashworth said under oath at his court martial. He confessed to using LSD three times while off duty. The first time, in the summer of 2015, shook him up. ""I didn't know if I was going to die that night or not,"" he said as a witness at another airman's drug trial. Recalling another episode with LSD, he said it felt ""almost as if I was going to have like a heart attack or a heat stroke.""
Airman Basic Kyle S. Morrison acknowledged at his court martial that under the influence of LSD he could not have responded if recalled to duty in a nuclear security emergency.
In prosecuting the cases at F.E. Warren, the Air Force asserted that LSD users can experience ""profound effects"" from even small amounts. It said common psychological effects include ""paranoia, fear and panic, unwanted and overwhelming feelings, unwanted life-changing spiritual experiences, and flashbacks.""
It's unclear how long before being on duty any of the airmen had taken LSD, which stands for lysergic acid diethylamide. The drug became popularized as ""acid"" in the 1960s, and views since then have been widely split on its mental health risks. Although illegal in the U.S., it had been showing up so infrequently in drug tests across the military that in December 2006 the Pentagon eliminated LSD screening from standard drug-testing procedures. An internal Pentagon memo at the time said that over the previous three years only four positive specimens had been identified in 2.1 million specimens screened for LSD.
Yet Air Force investigators found those implicated in the F.E. Warren drug ring used LSD on base and off, at least twice at outdoor gatherings. Some also snorted cocaine and used ecstasy. Civilians joined them in the LSD use, including some who had recently left Air Force service, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. The Air Force declined to discuss this.
Airman 1st Class Nickolos A. Harris, said to be the leader of the drug ring, testified that he had no trouble getting LSD and other drugs from civilian sources. He pleaded guilty to using and distributing LSD and using ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.
He acknowledged using LSD eight times and distributing LSD multiple times to fellow airmen at parties in Denver and other locations from spring 2015 to early 2016.
""I absolutely just loved altering my mind,"" he told the military judge, blaming his decisions to use hallucinogens and other drugs on his addictive personality.
Other airmen testified that it was easy to obtain LSD in a liquid form spread on small tabs of perforated white paper. Airmen ingested at least one tab by placing it on their tongue. In one episode summarized by a military judge at Harris' court martial, he and other airmen watched YouTube videos and ""then went longboarding on the streets of Denver while high on LSD.""
Harris was sentenced to 12 months in jail and other penalties, but under a pretrial agreement he avoided a punitive discharge. The lead prosecutor in that case, Air Force Capt. C. Rhodes Berry, had argued Harris should be locked up for 42 months, including nine months for the ""aggravating circumstance"" of undercutting public trust by using hallucinogens and other drugs on a nuclear weapons base.
""I cannot think of anything more aggravating than being the ringleader of a drug ring on F.E. Warren Air Force Base,"" Berry said at the courts martial.
In all, the AP obtained transcripts of seven courts martial proceedings, plus related documents. They provide vivid descriptions of LSD trips.
""I'm dying!"" one airman is Quote: d as exclaiming, followed by ""When is this going to end?"" during a ""bad trip"" on LSD in February 2016 at Curt Gowdy State Park, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Cheyenne, where F.E. Warren is located. A portion of that episode was video-recorded by one member of the group; a transcript of the audio was included in court records.
Others said they enjoyed the drug.
""Minutes felt like hours, colors seemed more vibrant and clear,"" Morrison testified. ""In general, I felt more alive."" He said he had used LSD in high school, which could have disqualified him from Air Force service; he said that his recruiter told him he should lie about it and that lying about prior drug use was ""normal"" in the Air Force.
At his court martial, Morrison acknowledged distributing LSD on the missile base in February 2016. A month later, when summoned for questioning by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Morrison confessed and became an informant for the agency, an arrangement the Air Force said yielded legally admissible evidence against 10 other airmen. Under a pretrial agreement, he agreed to testify against other airmen and avoided a punitive discharge. He was sentenced to five months' confinement, 15 days of hard labor and loss of $5,200 in pay.
Most of the airmen involved were members of two related security units at F.E. Warren — the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron and the 90th Security Forces Squadron. Together, they are responsible for the security and defense of the nuclear weapons there as well as the missile complex.
By coincidence, the No. 2 Pentagon official at the time, Robert Work, visited F.E. Warren one month before the drug investigation became public. Accompanied by an AP reporter, he watched as airmen of the 790th Missile Security Forces Squadron — whose members at the time included Harris, the accused leader of the drug ring — demonstrated how they would force their way into and regain control of a captured missile silo.
Work, the deputy defense secretary, was there to assess progress in fixing problems in the ICBM force identified by then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who ordered an investigation after the AP reported on personnel, resource, training and leadership problems in 2013-14. Those problems included the firing of the general in charge of the entire ICBM force for inappropriate behavior the Air Force said was linked to alcohol abuse. A month later the AP revealed that an unpublished study prepared for the Air Force found ""burnout"" among nuclear missile launch officers and evidence of broader behavioral problems, including sexual assaults and domestic violence. Air Force officials say the force has since rebounded.
In an interview, Work said he was not aware during his visit that anything was amiss. Nor was he briefed later on the investigation. He said he wouldn't have expected to be briefed unless the Air Force found that LSD or other illegal drugs were a ""systemic problem"" for the nuclear force, beyond the security forces group at F.E. Warren.
Work said he had never heard of LSD use anywhere in the nuclear workforce.
For the inexperienced members of the drug ring, Harris, the ringleader, had set out several ""rules"" for LSD use at a gathering of several airmen in a Cheyenne apartment in late 2015 that was recorded on video. Rule No. 1: ""No social media at all."" He added: ""No bad trips. Everybody's happy right now. Let's keep it that way.""
But social media proved their undoing. In March 2016, one member posted a Snapchat video of himself smoking marijuana, setting Air Force investigators on their trail.
As the investigators closed in, one of the accused, Airman 1st Class Devin R. Hagarty, grabbed a backpack and cash, text-messaged his mother that he loved her, turned off his cellphone and fled to Mexico. ""I started panicking,"" he told a military judge after giving himself up and being charged with desertion.
The Air Force said Hagarty was the first convicted deserter from an ICBM base since January 2013. In court, he admitted using LSD four times in 2015-16 and distributing it once, and he said he had deserted with the intention of never returning. He also admitted to using cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana multiple times. He was sentenced to 13 months in a military jail.
In all, disciplinary action was taken against 14 airmen. In addition, two accused airmen were acquitted at courts martial, and three other suspects were not charged.",2018-05-24T17:47:00.000+03:00
6944,YouTube's music ambitions might actually work this time,"YouTube's move to create its own streaming music service — despite a competitive product from its own company through Google Play Music — might not be as big of a headscratcher as one might at first think.
The company announced on Thursday it will launch YouTube Premium , which will not have ads, on May 22 for $9.99 a month. It will also offer a free ad-supported music service called YouTube Music and YouTube Music Premium for $11.99 per month.
Google is already in the streaming music market with Google Play Music and an older version of YouTube Music.
Here's why this time the attempt might work.
YouTube is already a go-to destination for music YouTube's viewers already use it for music in large numbers. That means it won't face the challenges of getting users to think of it as a ""music service."" They already do.
In fact, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said in September that 46 percent of all time spent listening to on-demand music is on YouTube. It also found 85 percent of YouTube users used the platform to stream music in the last month.
YouTube has tons of music videos Many of YouTube's popular videos are hosted by Vevo, a joint venture between Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. In 2017, Vevo racked up 300 billion views and increased its revenue to $650 million, according to the Financial Times . The $500 million revenue increase in one year was mostly due to higher ad revenue fees from YouTube.
It knows how to make money off music The company has been touting its music viewership numbers, especially as a way to prove it has brand-safe content to advertise on. During a recent advertiser presentation in New York, it announced it would allow companies to buy ads on any music content . The free YouTube Music service seems to fit in nicely with these plans.
It has money to throw at the wall Google's parent company Alphabet, which includes YouTube as part of Google's business unit, said it had a free cash flow of $4.34 billion during its latest quarterly report in April . That means there's plenty of money for Google to experiment.
It also probably explains why Google has attempted this before, with existing products such as Google Play Music and the current YouTube Music app.
Challenges Spotify and Apple Music are simple to understand — you go there for music — which is probably why they're so attractive to customers. Google's products can be more complicated.
When the new services roll out, it will offer the following products: YouTube, YouTube Premium, Google Play Music, YouTube Music, and YouTube Music Premium. Toss in its digital TV replacement YouTube TV and things get even more confusing for the everyday consumer.
Google needs to lay this out better for consumers. One strategy might be to kill Google Play Music. Then consumers will begin to realize that YouTube Music is the go-to Google service — and is the company's answer to Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora.
Google has the foundation to succeed in the space, it just needs to clean up its messaging.",2018-05-17T19:36:00.000+03:00

General Electric's earnings report are due out Friday morning, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the only thing of interest on the earnings calendar. 
GE is an interesting story, depending on how you look at it. The stock may be a fallen angel — with the potential to see a bit of relief — or the mangiest dog of the Dow, as I've called it before . GE's multiple 
Consider its valuation: GE's current cash flow projections, a massive debt load of $90 billion-plus and a now-lower dividend put fair valuation on the stock closer to $10 per share, versus its current price of around $13.69. 
Still, most of the bad news has been squeezed out of the stock, as the company basically divested itself of almost all of it GE Capital assets, and is now firmly focused on the industrial business. Where we go from here 
Traders will look to whether the company will cut guidance. This is something it has denied will come, but investors with a long-term outlook may want to focus on the prospects for a rebound and a presence abroad. For example, GE may find a boon in infrastructure projects in emerging African countries. 
A long-term bet on GE is, in a way, a bet on emerging market growth. The rate in emerging markets could far outpace the developed world, so investors who are willing to sit through short-term pain could see the stock double in the next decade if Africa becomes the next place to industrialize.",2018-04-19T14:03:00.000+03:00
160,"Trump hasn't made the dollar great again, and he apparently likes it that way","Days before he was inaugurated, then- President-elect Donald Trump shocked the currency world by saying the dollar was too strong.
In the year since his inauguration, the dollar index has lost 10 percent. A weak dollar helps U.S. exports and boosts foreign earnings of U.S. corporations.
Trump's words may have crushed a number of dollar long positions, but they aren't the reason the currency has been lagging and is now at a three-year low.
""I think the dollar might be being punished not because of what's going on in the U.S., but by what's going on in Europe and Japan,"" said Marc Chandler, head of fixed income strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""People are buying Europe and Japan. ... It's the relative business cycle. They are about to begin their adjustment process.""
Chandler and strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch say they expect the dollar to start strengthening. One caveat would be if Trump were to pursue protectionist strategies or start a trade war, which would send the dollar lower against the euro and yen.
Ben Randol, BofA's G-10 foreign exchange strategist, said he had expected the dollar to begin 2018 with a first-quarter gain, but the global central banks are working against it.
The Bank of Japan's adjustment in its quantitative easing purchases last week sparked speculation that it would tighten sooner than expected. The European Central Bank has also cut its QE purchases in half, and there's speculation it could end the program altogether later this year.
The market has been ignoring rising U.S. interest rates and the fact the Fed has forecast three interest-rate hikes for this year. Many economists expect it to do even more.
""There's a lot of Fed hiking that has yet to be priced in,"" said Randol. ""We see a lot of upside dollar risks going into this quarter.""
Randol said one thing that could help the dollar is the anticipated repatriation of cash by U.S. companies, which are responding to changes in the tax law. Apple on Wednesday announced it would pay a tax of $38 billion on repatriated funds, leading to speculation it will bring back $245 billion from overseas.
But Chandler said he expects that to be marginal since U.S. companies have already put that cash into Treasurys or dollar-denominated commercial paper to avoid currency risks.
What he does expect to see is a migration toward the dollar again because of interest rate differentials. Plus, European officials have begun to warn that the euro is too strong, something that could hit the export-driven European economy.
""This is a reverse of last year. Beginning last year, everyone and their sister was bullish the dollar. ... Now everyone is bearish , but bullish the yen and bullish the euro. The key is going to be interest rate differentials,"" Chandler said. ""It's paying you more to be long dollars than it has in a generation ... since the late 1990s.""
He noted a U.S. 10-year Treasury yields more than 2.57 percent, while a 10-year German bund yields 0.55, and the U.S. 2-year is now yielding 2.04 percent — to the 2-year bund's negative 0.58 yield.
Chandler also said European politics could begin to hit the euro, including the possible need for Germany to hold another election if it can't form a government. Its Socialist Democratic party meets Sunday.
In Spain, Catalan's wish to separate continues to be a problem for the government, and in Italy, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party is edging up.",2018-01-18T14:30:00.000+02:00
4067,"Solar power, already with growing pains, faces stagnation and headwinds after Trump tariffs","The United States will install less solar power than previously expected in coming years as big projects face challenges in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to slap tariffs on solar equipment, according to a new report.
The taxes on solar cell and panel imports announced earlier this year are dampening demand and compounding other headwinds in the industry, from slower expansion in critical state markets to a financial reckoning for installers who prized growth over balance sheet discipline.
That is the assessment of the Solar Energy Industries Association and clean tech analysis firm GTM Research in their annual review of the industry.
On the bright side, 2017 marked the second straight year of double-digit gigawatt growth in the solar industry. The sector added 10.6 gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity, the most common type of solar power technology.
U.S. Annual PV Installations, 2010-2017 , source: GTM Research
""The solar industry delivered impressively last year despite a trade case and market adjustments,"" SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a press release. ""Especially encouraging is the increasing geographic diversity in states deploying solar, from the Southeast to the Midwest, that led to a double digit increase in total capacity.""
But 2017 saw a 30-percent decrease from the record-setting addition of 15 gigawatts in 2016, when buyers rushed to purchase equipment ahead of the expiration of tax credits that were ultimately extended.
The outlook is more sobering over the next five years.
GTM lowered its forecast for solar installations during the 2018-2022 period by 13 percent, chalking up the revision to changes in federal and state policies, a potpourri of market headwinds across the major solar power segments, the fallout from Trump's tariffs and corporate tax reform impacts .
Trouble starts in 2018 This year, GTM expects U.S. growth to be flat at 10.6 gigawatts. The Trump effect won't play a big role in 2018 because many buyers purchased solar modules before the tariffs took effect.
This is especially true in the utility-scale segment, which builds large solar farms that feed into electric power markets and essentially work like power plants. GTM Research expects this segment to grow slightly more than it did last year.
But growth in utility-scale solar will be stagnant between 2020 and 2022 because the tariffs will delay and possibly kill some projects, GTM forecasts.
Projects will probably go forward in regulated markets like North Carolina and Florida, where state power authorities guarantee a return on investment. But the tariffs could have a big impact in smaller state markets that are just starting to adopt utility-scale solar.
U.S. PV Installation Forecast, source: GTM Research
Solar installations for residential homes are also seen rebounding in 2018, but the tariffs could cap gains, GTM says.
Growth in residential solar is slowing down because installers are struggling to add new customers in major markets like California and the Northeast. That slowdown is being exacerbated as large national retailers aim to cut costs and overhaul expensive sales strategies that have long weighed on profits.
Growth rates in residential solar could bounce back in the early 2020s if those companies can fix their finances, scale up new sales channels and push into new markets.
The outlook is similar in the solar market for businesses and other non-residential buyers, where GTM forecasts two consecutive years of lower installations. That's largely because the pipeline of approved non-residential projects will shrink this year and incentives will become less generous in major state markets in 2019.
But GTM said it expects the market to turn in 2020 as states like New York, Maryland and Illinois ramp up solar installations to meet ambitious renewable energy goals. The growing viability of storage solutions like large-scale batteries will also support solar power installations, the firm says.
Silver linings Despite headwinds in mature markets, the solar industry did see an encouraging trend: growth of installations in parts of the Southeast and Midwest where there's less renewable power penetration.
States outside of the top 10 markets now accounted for 21 percent of U.S. solar power capacity last year, up from 16 percent in 2016. The industry saw growth accelerate in 25 of the 44 states the Solar Energy Industries Association tracks.
Last year also saw an ""explosion"" in community solar, which allows homeowners to benefit from neighborhood projects rather than installing rooftop arrays.
Minnesota added more community solar capacity in 2017 than the entire United States installed in the previous year, according to the report. New York and Maryland are expected to expand community solar projects this year.",2018-03-15T06:09:00.000+02:00
5800,So you’ve been waitlisted—here are 3 things you should do,"Every year, thousands of applicants are placed on college waitlists, leaving parents and students to wonder — so now what?
About 39 percent of colleges use waitlists as a way to fill vacant spots in case accepted students choose not to matriculate. According to the National Association for College Admissions Counseling (NACAC), the number of students placed on a waitlist increased by 11 percent between 2015 and 2016, but just 23 percent of students who chose to remain on waitlists were accepted. At highly-selective institutions, the percentage is even lower — last year, Harvard accepted zero students off its waitlist.
Though the odds may not be in your favor, Kat Cohen, CEO and Founder of college guidance company IvyWise , tells CNBC Make It that there are several things students can do to improve their chances.
Here are three things you should do if you have been placed on a waitlist:
show chapters These are the top universities in the US 9:37 AM ET Tue, 12 Sept 2017 | 00:55 1. Follow directions The best thing a waitlisted student can do it follow directions carefully. For instance, many schools will require that students formally accept a place on the waitlist. If so, be sure to meticulously follow directions .
""Following directions is most important. If a college requests that you respond to accept your spot on the waitlist, do that first,"" says Cohen. ""Some schools allow and encourage students to send updates such as recommendation letters, waitlist letters, new test scores and spring semester grades, while other institutions specifically ask for students to refrain from sending additional materials.""
Going overboard can make it seem like you do not respect the guidelines provided and that you are unable to follow instruction.
""Don't send the school 10 new recommendation letters if they say they do not accept these documents,"" she says.
2. Reach out If you are really passionate about a school that you have been waitlisted at, writing a respectful, genuine and specific letter will help you stand out.
""Waitlisted letters can be a useful tool to reiterate your interest in a specific school, especially if they are crafted properly and include specific and relevant information,"" explains Cohen.
In this letter, students should express what makes them specifically excited for a school or program and how they plan to contribute to the school academically and socially. If this is your first choice school, be sure to say that.
Cohen says that students should resist the temptation to restate what has already been covered in their original application: ""Do not pad your waitlist letter by mentioning accomplishments that you already discussed in your initial application; admissions officers have already read and considered this information.""

""Even though a student who is waitlisted may be disappointed with this outcome, it is important to take an upbeat and optimistic tone when writing a waitlist follow up letter,"" explains Cohen. ""Do not question the school's decision or express remorse about your current application status.""
Instead, use your time and energy to focus on new accomplishments you've made since your application and talk about what makes you excited about college. Staying positive will not only help bump up your chances of getting in, but it can also help you cope during this stressful time.

The retailer's U.S. parent company is also suffering in its home market with reports it is preparing for potential liquidation, six months after filing for bankruptcy.

Toys ""R"" Us stores will disappear from Britain's shopping streets within six weeks, joint administrators for the retailer said on Wednesday, announcing plans to close the group's remaining 75 shops. 
The administrators said in a statement they had not been able to find a buyer for all or part of the business, resulting in the loss of about 3,000 jobs. 
The UK arm of Toys ""R"" Us entered administration, a form of creditor protection, in February, sunk by weak consumer sentiment, the growth of online sales and currency swings as a result of Brexit.

In Britain, the administrators had been trying to sell parts of the business. 
""This process attracted some interest, but ultimately no party has been able to move forward with a formal bid prior to the expiration of the stated deadline,"" joint administrator Simon Thomas, a partner at corporate advisory and restructuring firm Moorfields said in a statement.

2869,Trump likes to cite black employment data as a positive economic indicator. It just got worse,"For the average American, the nearly 8-year-old recovery in the job market continues to make it easier to find steady work with a solid paycheck.
But the averages mask big disparities in the way the benefits of that recovery are being felt across racial and ethnic lines.
President Donald Trump during his State of the Union address Tuesday took credit for the ongoing strength in hiring, singling out the drop in unemployment among black workers.
""Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low,"" Trump told Congress. ""It's something I'm very proud of. African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.""
Not anymore. Last month, the jobless rate among blacks jumped nearly a full point to 7.7 percent , according to the latest monthly data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Even at its low point, the jobless rate for black Americans has been roughly twice the rate for whites since the job market recovery began in March 2010.
Those higher jobless rates for blacks may understate the overall level of unemployment for that group, which has a lower labor force participation rate than other groups tracked by the BLS. (The labor force participation rate measures the share of the overall population that is actively in the workforce and excludes, among others, those who have given up looking for a job.)",2018-02-02T21:32:00.000+02:00
3777,No-frills micro hospitals with as few as 8 rooms emerge as a new way to cut health-care costs,"Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican neighborhood hospital in Las Vegas. 
The future of health care looks small and digital. 
Micro hospitals are emerging in some suburban and urban markets as a backup to community facilities — or in regions where there is not enough demand for full-sized hospitals. The facilities range from 15,000 to 60,000 square feet, substantially smaller than community hospitals, and offer as few as eight beds. 
""We still have to be fully prepared to see and treat any patient that walks through our doors,"" Laura Hennum, a regional CEO of the Dignity Health St. Rose-Dominican Neighborhood Hospitals, told CNBC. She's responsible for four micro facilities in the greater Las Vegas area. 
These smaller facilities can provide lower-cost care for patients compared with traditional community hospitals, Dr. Richard Zane, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Colorado, told CNBC. 
Mega hospitals, which can offer as many as 1,000-plus beds, ""have evolved into large, profitable, expensive, technology-laden institutions,"" Zane said. 
By contrast, micro hospitals can perform many of the same services as larger ones, and through the advent of technology and shorter hospital stays, can lower patient costs, Zane said. 
""Micro hospitals are the decentralization of health care,"" he said. ""You can match the cost of care to the perfect environment."" Zane, who has experience with implementing systems of emergency care and access, added patients typically follow up with their care providers virtually, thus lowering costs even more. ""We still have to be fully prepared to see and treat any patient that walks through the door."" -Laura Hennum, a regional CEO of the Dignity Health St. Rose-Dominican Neighborhood Hospitals 
Micro hospitals appear to be one of many possible solutions to lower health costs for some communities as health spending rises in the U.S. and corporations begin to take the cost of care for employees into their own hands. 
Berkshire Hathaway 's Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that health-care spending is a "" tapeworm on the economic system ."" His venture with Amazon 's Jeff Bezos and J.P. Morgan 's Jamie Dimon , announced in late January , is designed to cut health costs and improve services for the three companies' U.S. employees. 
Additionally, CNBC has learned U.S. tech giant Apple is launching a group of health clinics called AC Wellness for its employees and their families this spring. The primary care group will initially only serve Apple's employees in Santa Clara County, California, where its headquarters are located. Micro hospitals can provide more personalized care 
Micro hospitals, also called neighborhood hospitals, have cropped up in states such as Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. Saint Luke's Health System in Leawood, Kansas, recently opened its own 17,000-square-foot micro hospital, no bigger than an average CVS Health store. 
Hennum at Dignity Health St. Rose-Dominican told CNBC these facilities are not meant to replace larger hospitals or emergency rooms but can provide a kinder, more personalized level of care. 
Hennum said the micro facilities can treat things like gunshot wounds and high-risk pregnancies, adding patients usually wait no longer than 11 minutes, on average, from entering the door to seeing a doctor. 
""We only transfer 5 percent, or sometimes in other locations, 4 percent of our patients,"" Hennum told CNBC. ""We treat or discharge the vast majority of patients we see. ... And we brought additional jobs to our community. I've interviewed more than 250 people."" 
Larger hospitals still have their place, however. Mega hospitals have the resources to perform intensive and complex procedures whereas micro hospitals tend to be less surgical, Zane told CNBC. 
For example, a person experiencing a stroke or in need of certain cancer therapies will be treated by larger facilities or specialized centers, Zane said. Micro facilities can do routine surgical care like a knee replacement that would only require a doctor and an assistant, but nothing like a liver transplant, Zane explained. 
Hennum said Dignity Health St. Rose-Dominican's emergency rooms are prepared to address any patient issues that come through its doors. Typical patients they transfer include those who have had a stroke or are suffering from a STEMI, a very serious type of heart attack where one of the heart's arteries is blocked. 
Dignity Health St. Rose-Dominican, which owns and operates 39 hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada, is in a partnership with Emerus for the neighborhood hospitals in Las Vegas. 
Emerus, a developer of micro hospitals, has more than 28 facilities nationwide and more than 20 under development. Hennum said the company is focused on innovation and consistently acquires the expertise of experienced health-care professionals.

4433,"Global trade has an issue with trust, IMF's Lagarde says","The lack of trust among global trade partners must be fixed, Christine Lagarde , managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), told CNBC on Thursday.
Tensions in global trade have spiked in recent months, with the U.S. imposing new metal tariffs on countries including allies. Donald Trump's administration has since announced duties specifically on Chinese goods for breaking intellectual property rules in the U.S. Beijing prepared retaliatory measures, but said it is willing to talk trade with the United States. Trump has since threatened to impose further tariffs worth $100 billion on China.
When asked if imposing duties was a successful way to force partners to negotiate trade terms, Lagarde told CNBC's Sara Eisen: ""I believe there is an issue of trust that needs to be preserved.""
Stephen Jaffe | IMF | Getty Images Speaking at the World Bank's and IMF's Spring Meetings 2018 conference in Washington, she added: ""And when operators, investors, companies are uncertain about terms and conditions under which to organize the supply chain, terms and conditions under which they are going to trade, types of tariffs that they are going to have to pay, they step back and they don't invest, they delay, they wait.""
Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. and Japan would be discussing ways to boost their trade partnership. The president added that this is his favorite approach to trade — bilaterally.
However, Lagarde told CNBC that in order to deal with trade imbalances ""all countries have to be at the table.""
""We have seen protectionist measures on the rise for the last three years, there are issues about intellectual property, there are issues about subsidies to state-owned enterprises, and those have to be debated, they have to be discussed so that there is free trade,"" she said.
show chapters IMF's Lagarde on global growth, trade wars and looming deficits 6 Hours Ago | 09:49 Calling for a ""determined"" attitude to address trade issues, Lagarde said: ""At the end of the day, enterprises, companies, corporates — they operate on a cross-border basis, they know no boundaries. ...

4973,Here are the highlights of the market-moving speech by China's Xi and the US stocks that could benefit,"CNBC.com Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Xi Jinping, China's president, speaks at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in Boao, China, on Tuesday, April 10, 2018. 
In a wide-ranging speech Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping laid out plans for several key areas to make the domestic economy more accessible to foreign businesses. 
His remarks at the Boao Forum for Asia alleviated market fears about a U.S.-China trade war and U.S. stocks soared more than 1 percent in the open. 
While Xi has addressed these areas of reform previously, Tuesday's comments contrasted with defensive statements from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce last week in the wake of escalating trade tensions with the U.S. 
Here are some of the highlights of Xi's remarks, and some U.S. industries or companies that may benefit: Increasing imports 
""China does not seek [a] trade surplus. We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve greater balance of international payments under the current account,"" Xi said, according to a translation of the speech . The Chinese president also highlighted the first China International Import Expo, set to take place in Shanghai in November, and said it will be an annual event. 
Boosting imports helps Beijing in its years-long effort to transition the country from being a manufacturing base dependent on exports into a consumption-driven economy. 
Macquarie's China economist Larry Hu expects the country could import more medicine, energy and large aircraft. 
""Note that China only put smaller planes on its retaliation list to the U.S. but excluded the 747 and other big planes,"" Hu said in a Tuesday report. Autos 
Beijing will significantly lower tariffs on imports of automobiles, and also loosen restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto sector, Xi said. Less than 24 hours earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that China's 25 percent tariff on U.S.-made cars versus a 2.5 percent tariff on Chinese-made cars in the U.S. was ""stupid trade."" 
China is a key market for major U.S. automakers, and shares of GM and Ford climbed nearly 2 percent or more Tuesday morning. 
General Motors said in January that China was its largest retail market for a sixth-straight year , benefitting from record domestic sales by the Cadillac, Buick and Baojun brands. GM and its joint ventures sold more than 4 million vehicles in China for the first time in 2017, an increase of 4.4 percent. 
Ford announced in December that it plans to grow its China revenue by 50 percent by 2025 versus 2017. 
China is Tesla 's second-largest source of revenue after the U.S., and sales in the Asian nation doubled to $2 billion in 2017 from the prior year, according to a 10-K filing. Financial services 
China will speed up its efforts to open up the insurance industry and ease restrictions on the establishment of foreign financial firms domestically, Xi said. The country will also open up more areas of cooperation between Chinese and foreign financial markets, he said, according to an English-language report from state media . 
Xi also reiterated that China will allow greater foreign investment in banking, securities and insurance. ""We will ensure that these measures are materialized, he said, according to a translation. 
The statements come as China has been slowly opening up its historically closed financial markets to global investors. 
Franklin Resources , BlackRock and Invesco top UBS's list of U.S. asset managers best positioned to operate in China, according to an April 4 report. 
Among the major U.S. investment banks, Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Citi have an edge over their peers, the UBS report said. Protecting intellectual property rights 
Xi said China will step up enforcement of intellectual property rights protection and significantly raise the cost for offenders. 
""We encourage normal technological exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and foreign enterprises, and protect the lawful IPR owned by foreign enterprises in China,"" he said, according to an English translation by Xinhua state media . 
The latest annual survey released in January from the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that m ore than half of member respondents said they still believe intellectual property leakage and data security threats are higher in China than other parts of the world. 
""U.S. industries that could benefit from positive enforcement action by China are aviation, AI/machine learning, sensors, semiconductor manufacturing and design, and perhaps copyrighted software,"" said David Pratt, managing director at MCAM International, said in an email. MCAM maintains an archive of documents related to patents and other intangible assets from many countries. 
""As China makes advances in artificial intelligence, sensor technologies, aviation manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication among other sectors, its stake in effective IP enforcement has been growing,"" Pratt said.",2018-04-10T17:41:00.000+03:00

2961,Trump's lawyer seeks $20 million in damages from porn star Stormy Daniels,"Taxes Trump's lawyers seek $20 million in damages from porn star Stormy Daniels A law firm representing U.S. President Donald Trump said in a court filing that it was seeking at least $20 million in damages for multiple violations of a nondisclosure agreement. Under the nondisclosure agreement, Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, could be subjected to a $1 million penalty each time the deal was broken. Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represents Daniels, said on Friday: ""This is simply more of the same bullying tactics from the president and Mr. Cohen. Published 10 Hours Ago Reuters Getty Images Stormy Daniels attends the 2018 Adult Video News Awards at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino on January 27, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
A law firm representing U.S. President Donald Trump and the corporation that paid porn actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in what she called hush money over an alleged affair with Trump said in a court filing that it was seeking at least $20 million in damages for multiple violations of a nondisclosure agreement. 
In a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California made public on Friday, the Blakely Law Group also asked for a lawsuit by Daniels that seeks to nullify the agreement to be moved to a federal district court from a county court. 
Brent Blakely, who filed the action on behalf of Essential Consultants LLC and Trump, did not reply to a request for comment. 
Under the nondisclosure agreement, Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, could be subjected to a $1 million penalty each time the deal was broken. 
Daniels has alleged that she had an affair with Trump that began in 2006 and lasted several months. 
Michael Cohen, a private lawyer for Trump, has said he paid Daniels $130,000 of his own money during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Cohen has not explained why he made the payment and has not said if Trump was aware of it. 
Attorney Michael Avenatti, who represents Daniels, said on Friday: ""This is simply more of the same bullying tactics from the president and Mr. Cohen. They are now attempting to remove this case in order to increase their chances that the matter will ultimately be decided in private arbitration, behind closed doors, outside of public view and scrutiny. 
""To put it simply — they want to hide the truth from the American people. We will oppose this effort at every turn."" 
Avenatti has filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles claiming Trump never signed the nondisclosure agreement, rendering it null and void. 
""The fact that a sitting president is pursuing over $20 million in bogus 'damages' against a private citizen, who is only trying to tell the public what really happened, is truly remarkable,"" Avenatti said. 
In a letter to Cohen on Monday, Daniels offered to return the $130,000 to an account designated by Trump so she could be released from the agreement, which she signed in October 2016. Cohen ignored the offer. 
Earlier on Friday, Avenatti told MSNBC and CNN that Daniels had been physically threatened and warned to remain silent about her relationship with Trump. 
Avenatti would not provide details about the threat. He said Clifford would elaborate on it during a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview due to be broadcast on March 25. 
He told Reuters on Friday that six women had been in touch with his law firm to describe relationships with Trump, and that two had signed nondisclosure agreements.",2018-03-17T08:16:00.000+02:00
5980,This simple form can keep you from overpaying for medical care,"You know that ""explanation of benefits"" form you get from your insurance company? Resist the urge to toss it in the trash.
Even if it looks like a bewildering mess of numbers, codes and abbreviations, there's a good reason to learn how to make sense of it.
Basically, this EOB, as it's known, could be what keeps you from overpaying for your medical care.
""You have to make sure the EOB is right and compare it with the bill from your provider to make sure they match, because they don't always,"" said Mitch Rothschild, founder and chairman of consumer health-care site Vitals.com.
Photo by Minerva Studio via Getty Images As health-care costs continue climbing and patients take on a larger share of those expenses, containing the effect on your budget is worth it.
Annual premiums for employer-sponsored family coverage reached $18,764 in 2017, with workers paying an average $5,714 out of pocket, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
That amount does not include what you might spend to actually go to a doctor. Depending on the specifics of the care you receive and your insurance coverage, using the health-care system could add hundreds or thousands of dollars to your annual outlay.
Insurers are required by law to send you an EOB every time your doctor or other provider files a claim for treating you. As its name implies, the form's intent is to show you what your insurance plan is covering for care you've received.
Yet mistakes happen in the medical billing process. Exactly how often, however, is hard to come by.
While research from the American Medical Association showed that 7.1 percent of all claims paid by insurers in 2013 contained a mistake, patient advocates and other professionals who review medical claims for accuracy put the frequency of billing errors at more like 80 percent or even 90 percent.
""You'd be shocked by how often mistakes are made,"" said Missy Conley, director of consumer claims for Medliminal.com, which reviews medical bills on behalf of clients.
(Source: Vitals.com)
Of course, to figure out whether your provider or insurance company flubbed, you have to know what to look for on the EOB.
While federal and state laws dictate the information included, each insurance company can choose exactly how to present it. Generally, though, there are some things you should look for.
The full-price amount the provider would charge for the service you received. Assuming your doctor is in-network, this amount is typically higher than what the insurance company permits the provider to charge as a participating provider. The rate that the insurance company allows the provider to charge. This is a discounted price that the provider and insurance company have agreed to. In other words, for your doctors to be part of your plan's network, they agreed to lower compensation for a particular service or procedure. The amount of the negotiated rate getting covered by your plan. This number depends on the specifics of your coverage, such as whether you have a deductible to meet, or a copay (the flat rate you pay each time for, say, a doctor's visit) or coinsurance (a percentage of the amount you are responsible for). The patient's responsibility. This is your share of the total cost. show chapters Avoiding health care 5:36 PM ET Fri, 20 April 2018 | 02:55 It's important to note that the discounted rate for your in-network doctor or other provider should be the starting point for any coinsurance or deductible you are responsible for.
For example, if the doctor's full rate is $200 and the discounted cost is $100, the lower price is what would count against any deductible you have to meet. Or if you have coinsurance of, say, 20 percent, you're responsible for that percentage of $100, not $200.
""Sometimes there's the mistake of not basing your share on the discounted rate,"" Vitals.com's Rothschild said.
Coding errors also can be the culprit. For instance, if a routine screening that is 100 percent covered by your insurance plan is coded incorrectly, your insurer might note on the EOB that you owe the full amount.

If you believe there's an error on your EOB, you should start by calling your insurance company, said Conley at Medliminal.com.
""If the claim was processed incorrectly, they'll get on a conference call with your provider to correct the billing,"" she said.
Some companies offer billing advocacy services for workers who need help making sense of their bill or getting errors fixed. If your employer has this perk, take advantage of it. You also can hire a specialized advocacy firm, which typically reviews bills for free and takes a cut of whatever amount they save you.
Even if everything on an EOB looks accurate, make sure you hold on to it to compare with the bill you get from your provider before you pay it. Sometimes, the doctor's bill will say you owe a higher amount than what's on the EOB.
""Go by what the insurance company says, not the bill,"" said Jeanne Woodward, vice president of consumer claims at Medliminal.
Errors tend to be more prevalent when you end up in the hospital. Due to the variety of doctors who tend to you and tests or procedures ordered, there can be many different individual providers that end up filing a claim with your insurance company.

2200,Nordstrom family aims for go-private deal before earnings: Sources,"Nordstrom 's founding family group hopes to seal a deal to take the company private before it reports earnings next Thursday, sources told CNBC, though cautioning that goal may be lofty. 
The department store chain has met with investment banks to discuss financing for a new bid, said the sources, who requested to remain anonymous because the talks are private. 
The sources also cautioned that timing may change and it remains a challenging environment for financing. Nordstrom has yet to put together a financing package, they said. 
Nordstrom's stock soared more than 6 percent Friday afternoon on an initial report from Reuters that the department store chain was finalizing its take-private offer. Nordstrom declined CNBC's request for comment. 
Going private remains a desirable course for at least some of Nordstrom's family members. The public market has been punishing to all retailers, hindering them from making many of the moves necessary to readjust to the changing retail landscape. For Nordstrom and others, these include costly e-commerce investments and the need to realign stores. 
The family group, which owns 31.2 percent of Nordstrom, last year linked up with private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners to help fund their efforts to take it private. That effort stalled over financing skittishness , amid a bubbling number of bankrupt leveraged buyouts and general uncertainty over the future of retail. 
In October, the Nordstrom family officially suspended its attempt to take the retailer private due to challenges in arranging debt financing ahead of the holidays. 
As the family members seek to cobble together new financing, they may still find themselves short. Even a relatively strong holiday shopping season for Nordstrom won't alleviate long-term concerns about the future of the retail industry.",2018-02-23T21:37:00.000+02:00

7234,Nvidia CEO: My mom taught me English a 'random 10 words at a time' before we emigrated from Taiwan,"Taiwanese-American billionaire Jensen Huang's company is at the forefront of technological solutions for artificial intelligence, video gaming and autonomous cars.
But the co-founder and CEO of Silicon Valley-based Nvidia , a maker of powerful computer chips, credits his parents for putting him on the road to success.
""I'm the product of my parents' dreams and aspirations,"" Huang, who is married with two children of his own, told CNBC's ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in a recent interview.
In the late 1960s, Huang's father, who was then in his 30s, visited the United States for the first time, traveling from Taiwan to New York City for a worker training program.
When he returned from training with Carrier, an air conditioner maker now owned by United Technologies , the elder Huang vowed to send Jensen and his older brother to America.
""[In] the pursuing years, my mom taught us English to prepare us,"" the Nvidia chief said. ""At the time, my mom didn't understand any English at all.""
But that didn't stop his mother, Huang, now 55, told Cramer. ""Every single day, she would pick a random 10 words from the dictionary and ask us to spell it and ask us to tell her the meaning.""
""She [had] no idea whether we'd said it right or not. But nonetheless, my father's dream [and] my mom's aspirations for our success [are] what ultimately put us here,"" he said.
""I owe them a great deal,"" added Huang, who is worth an estimated $5.6 billion, according to Forbes . As of Thursday, May 3, Nvidia's stock market value was more than $140 billion.
In the past five years, Nvidia stock has soared roughly 1,500 percent from around $14.40 per share in May 2013 to around $232 per share as of Thursday's close.
Huang, who co-founded Nvidia in 1993, arrived in the United States in the early 1970s with his brother. Their parents sent them to live with relatives while they got their education.
In previous interviews , Huang said that growing up playing video games taught him perseverance. Losing over and over again made him push himself to win, he said in 2010.
Huang later attended Oregon State University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering — perhaps inspired by his father's chemical engineering background.
Waiting tables at Denny's in his 20s brought the future Nvidia CEO out of his shell by teaching him how ""make the best of a state of chaos,"" he once told the New York Times .
Huang went on to earn a master's degree in engineering from Stanford University. By 29, Huang and two friends — engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem — co-founded Nvidia with just $40,000.
In 1999, Huang led Nvidia to create GPUs, or graphics processing units, which became integral to the development of graphic-intensive video gaming and, eventually, machine learning.
In a 2009 blog post , Nvidia described the GPU as a computer's ""soul"" to the central processing unit's ""brain.""

""Fiscal policy is spinning out of control again in Washington, D.C.,"" said Walker, who was head of the GAO under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
""We are mortgaging the future of kids and grandkids at record rates. That is irresponsible. It is unethical. It is immoral. It must stop,"" he told "" Closing Bell .""
On Friday, signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill into law , despite being ""unhappy about it.""
Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images The legislation, which funds the government through the end of September, significantly boosts military spending. It also increases funding for border security, infrastructure and efforts to fight the opioid epidemic.
""We've seen the debt ceiling limit go up $1 trillion in the last year. We're facing trillion-dollar annual deficits starting in '19, and we can see on the horizon that the federal budget may end up spending $1 trillion on interest alone in the not-too-distant future. And what do you get for interest? Nothing,"" said Walker, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Connecticut.
He's particularly concerned about the 70 percent of the budget that's on ""autopilot"" — so-called mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.
""We have made no meaningful progress on diffusing that ticking time bomb,"" Walker said. ""That's what we have to get to if we want to restore fiscal sanity.""
It's a different story on the Republican tax plan, which he thinks will create additional economic growth and job opportunities.
That additional growth will produce some revenues, he said.
""But let's understand this ... our fiscal gap is too great to close it with growth alone.""

253,US cannabis companies look to Canada when going public,"California-based cannabis company MedMen wants to go public — in Canada.
MedMen, which operates dispensaries and production facilities in three states and has 700 employees, may be one of the biggest American cannabis companies to look to the north for growth, but it isn't the first, and it certainly won't be the last.
""There is this unique situation where people are very excited about an industry, but there are legal and regulatory blocks to opening capital flow,"" said Troy Dayton, CEO of cannabis investment and market research firm Arcview Group.
Facing regulatory restriction and fearing federal government intervention, an increasing number of American cannabis companies are looking to list on international stock exchanges. And Canada, which plans to legalize recreational and medical marijuana nationwide by fall , has some of the most ""420-friendly"" markets around.
MedMen CEO and co-founder Adam Bierman took the stage on Wednesday at a cannabis conference hosted by Canaccord Genuity in Vancouver. He plans a reverse takeover with a listed shell company rather than an initial public offering.
""There is so much excitement now around legalization nationally coming in Canada. There is so much excitement about the fact that California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts all legalized recreational marijuana,"" Bierman said.
""The Canadian public markets offer access to a lot of capital, with a lot of certainty and a lot of speed, and there is this appetite among global investors to invest in a U.S. play,"" he said. ""Specifically, global investors want to invest in a U.S. play that has California exposure. Now is the time where it makes the most sense.""
Source: MedMen MedMen operates sleek, airy dispensaries that are designed to attract marijuana customers of all types — a far cry from the psychedelic-style head shops of days past. The company also has two funds with about $150 million to encourage investment in marijuana businesses. They caught the attention of some big names in finance, such as former BlackRock Chief Investment Officer Chris Leavy, who chaired the first fund, and former Goldman Sachs investment banker Ruth Epstein.
Most of these assets have been rolled into MedMen Enterprises in preparation for a reverse takeover to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), an alternative exchange. Bierman anticipates MedMen will list sometime in the second quarter of 2018. MedMen is currently searching for a partner.
Canada's largest exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), lists few cannabis companies, according to information provided by the exchange. The combined capitalization of big names that are listed there, such as Canopy Growth and Aphria , among others, exceeds $20 billion. All companies currently listed on TSX are based in Canada.
The CSE is a bit more lenient. The exchange currently trades close to 60 cannabis-related companies, many that are headquartered in the U.S. The market caps for these companies are significantly smaller. U.S. companies listed on the CSE, such as Alternate Health and iAnthus Capital, have a combined market cap of about $230 million, according to public information on the CSE's website.
In the U.S., the major exchanges have stringent listing requirements, including revenue and market capitalization hurdles.
This poses a major problem for marijuana companies. Until recently most investors viewed the entire cannabis industry as far too risky. Some creative investment solutions have emerged, such as ETF Managers Group's Alternative Harvest ETF, but most institutional investors still won't touch the stuff.
Source: MedMen ""To get on NYSE and Nasdaq you have to be huge,"" CSE CEO Richard Carleton said. ""In Canada you continue to be able to develop public companies in the public space. We know how to do smaller deals for smaller companies on the stock exchange.""
Continued legal restrictions and hurdles to list on major exchanges in the U.S. are prompting more American cannabis companies to eye Canadian exchanges.
""I have a strong pipeline of Canadian and U.S. companies that have applied to list on the exchange,"" Carleton said. ""That tells me that there is a lot of room to grow in terms of build-out of the legal cannabis structure in the U.S.""
The local financial system benefits as well. In this case, Canada will have an advantage on intellectual property, investment dollars and tax money from the cannabis industry, as well as developing investment opportunities in cannabis.
""This is the United States' industry to lose,"" Dayton said. ""Because of the federal-state conflict we have here, countries like Canada, Germany, Brazil, Israel have a unique opportunity to take this industry from the U.S.""

According to Devitt, Noto's departure will cause Jack Dorsey, who currently holds CEO positions at both Twitter and Square, to spend more time at Twitter and less at Square. As a result, Friar could have more management responsibilities at Square.
""It is likely that the events at Twitter will lead to a broad reassessment of Jack Dorsey's overall time spent and the possible elevation of certain deserving Square executives,"" Devitt wrote in the note.

5539,Cramer: Buy United Rentals over Caterpillar as US-China trade disputes loom,"18 Hours Ago | 01:06 
U.S.-China tensions over trade may have abated for now, but with China ready to escalate at any moment, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted investors to be prepared for potential pain. 
""Stocks like Caterpillar have been rebounding nicely after getting absolutely eviscerated over the past few months. I say wait a second. Not so fast,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said on Thursday. 
While shares of Caterpillar have more than tripled since their early 2016 lows and business at the construction equipment giant is booming, Cramer warned that it does a lot of business in China. 
And despite the stock's rally after China President Xi Jinping struck a more conciliatory tone on trade in a recent speech, Cramer saw Caterpillar as an obvious target for Chinese retaliation. 
""You should swap out of CAT and swap into United Rentals , URI, the big domestic machinery rental play,"" he recommended. ""United Rentals gives you the same great earth-moving and construction equipment exposure that Caterpillar does without any of the China related risk."" 
Here's why Cramer would buy United Rentals' stock over Caterpillar's: 1. Geography 
For one, United Rentals does 91.5 percent of its sales in the United States, with the remaining 8.5 percent coming from Canada. Caterpillar, however, gets less than 41 percent of its sales from the United States — the rest comes from overseas. 
""It's true that only an estimated 5 percent of CAT's current sales come from China,"" Cramer admitted. ""But here's the thing: the Chinese market is a huge component of the company's long-term growth strategy."" 
In the last year, the Asia-Pacific region grew at a rate of 40 to 51 percent, making it the fastest-growing region on Caterpillar's books. That gave Caterpillar a major boost when North American markets weakened, but the potential for a trade war threatens the numbers, Cramer said. 2. Exposure 
Cramer also took a merit-based approach to United Rentals' business. Trade disputes aside, the rental giant has a better mix of end markets than Caterpillar for the current environment, he said. 
About 50 percent of United Rentals' business comes from industrial and non-construction rentals. Forty-six percent of that comes from commercial construction, which improves when the business cycle picks up, as it is now, the ""Mad Money"" host said. 
As for Caterpillar, roughly 40 percent of its sales are tied to construction, and about 50 percent are tied to the energy, transportation and natural resources industries. 
""Caterpillar has a lot more exposure to commodities, and while commodities have been trending higher of late, these resource-related industries are much more boom and bust,"" Cramer said. ""When those industries drop off, they really drop off. That probably won't happen any time soon, but United Rentals is much closer to a pure play on the resurgent U.S. economy and that's what we like in Cramerica."" 3. Fundamentals 
Third, Cramer considers the equipment rental business to be stronger than the equipment manufacturing business. United Rentals' margins benefit from not having the fixed costs that Caterpillar has from actually making the equipment they sell and rent. 
""CAT's all about manufacturing and then selling big-ticket items, which is inherently a lot more risky,"" he said. Conclusions 
All in all, Cramer found United Rentals, the stock and the company, to be a much more attractive play than Caterpillar. 
Shares of United Rentals trade at just 12 times this year's earnings estimates while Caterpillar shares sell for 16 times. And although Caterpillar can grow faster, the risks, particularly the wild card of China, are piling up. 
""Let me give you the bottom line on these two: Caterpillar is a great stock to own in a world where everything's hunky-dory, but we're in a more challenging environment now. Even if the Chinese never slap tariffs on Caterpillar's machinery, the very fact that they might be willing to do so is enough to hold back this stock, at least until we get some kind of resolution to the trade dispute,"" Cramer said. 
""That's why I think United Rentals is the better buy here, and it's why its stock has been behaving so much better than CAT's for the past few months,"" he concluded. ""I bet it continues to perform better, which is why you should swap out of CAT and into URI if you think that the president still wants to play hardball with the Chinese.""

4682,"Don’t play into the hype. Netflix is not a buy at these levels, says market watcher","With shares up more than 60 percent this year, it seems everyone is pressing play on Netflix . Not contrarian Michael Binger , senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.
""I don't think I would step into Netflix stock price at these levels right here now,"" Binger told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Friday.
""I'm not going to deny Netflix is a great company,"" he added. ""They're changing the way we watch TV and the way we stream video, but at 70 times earnings for a company that doesn't generate any cash flow, it's hard for me to invest at these levels.""
While the S&P 500 remains in the red for 2018, the streaming service has screamed ahead with 62 percent in gains. It's the second-best performer on the benchmark index.
But those gains have also made for an expensive valuation for Netflix. Its shares trade at 97 times forward earnings, far higher than the 16.5 times multiple on the S&P 500. Netflix's relative strength index, a measure of overbought conditions, sits at 58. A reading above 70 indicates overbought territory.
Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global, echoes Binger's caution and hedges with a ""wait-and-see approach.""
""At these high valuations, they're basically just earning their keep at the moment. They're not necessarily earning a higher valuation,"" Sanchez told ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.
From a business point of view, Sanchez says the company is delivering. She predicts greater profitability next year as it slows its spending on original content and moves toward cash flow positive territory. Comcast's latest offer to include the streaming service as part of its subscription bundles is also a plus, she says.
However, those factors do not make Netflix shares any more attractive to Sanchez.
""We have to take a wait-and-see approach because we have priced in all of the good things that are happening,"" said Sanchez. ""Wait and see is probably where you need to be on Netflix.""
Binger, too, is keeping cautious.
""I'd much rather step back and if for some reason this stock price came down a little bit, invest then,"" said Binger.
Others on the Street are more bullish on Netflix. Deutsche Bank on Friday upgraded its rating to buy from hold, based on expected strength in international markets this year. Analyst Bryan Kraft said that its leadership in the space had made it ""very difficult for the traditional media companies, or even other big tech companies, to catch up.""
Kraft also upped his price target to $350, implying 12 percent upside from current levels.
Netflix is scheduled to report earnings after the bell Monday. Analysts anticipate 57 percent growth in first-quarter profit and a 39 percent increase in sales. The company is expected to have added 1.48 million domestic subscribers and 5 million international subscribers.

4723,"Hope for an US-China trade agreement just got 'thrown under the bus,' says a Wall Street veteran","Optimism that negotiations between the United States and China over recent trade tensions has taken a hit and investors are getting impatient, according to Wall Street veteran Peter Boockvar .
Boockvar's comments came after said late on Thursday that he had told the U.S. Trade Representative to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese products given what he said was China's ""unfair retaliation.""
""Any hope that this spat with China was going to stay contained with an ultimate agreement at the end of the day just got thrown under the bus,"" Boockvar, who is chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in an email following the most recent development in an escalating tit-for-tat on U.S.-China trade relations.
""Markets are deservingly losing patience with the administration's approach to this,"" he said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said those new tariffs would not be imposed until a public comment process was concluded.
Despite that attempt to downplay tensions, U.S. stock index futures tumbled on the back of Trump's statement, with Dow Jones industrial average futures indicating a more than 400-point drop at one point.
As of 8:25 p.m. ET, the implied open for Dow futures was more than 350 points lower.
Trump's statement came after China on Wednesday unveiled a list of 106 U.S. products, including soybeans and cars, that face additional tariffs , although no start date was announced.
That, in turn, came hot on the heels of the Trump administration's announcement that it intended to target a list of Chinese imports for what it deemed unfair trade practices.
Boockvar told CNBC on Wednesday that China's retaliatory tariffs would further weaken the market, raising the cost of doing business for American companies and diminish business for the U.S.

3991,Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber on working her way to the top and bringing others with her,"Women make up nearly 50 percent of the U.S. labor force, but they account for just 25 percent of executive and senior level positions at S&P 500 companies, according to the Center for American Progress . That percentage is even smaller when you look at board seats and CEO positions, of which women hold just 20 percent and six percent, respectively. 
One leader who is encouraging companies to not only hire women, but promote them is Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber. Having worked her way up the company's ranks from an entry-level position to CEO, Alber says she's aware of her influence as one of the few female leaders in her industry. 
""I think there's not enough role models of women, different types of women, in senior jobs,"" she tells CNBC . ""I think that's what we really need to change, and something that drives me every day. It's one of the reasons why I've really stuck with it because I realize it's bigger than just me in this job. I can inspire young women and show them that you can be in this job not just for a short period of time, but for a long period of time.""
Photo courtesy of Getty Alber started her career in retail as a recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who moved to the west coast without any job prospects or connections. 
""To have had a mentor would have been comforting,"" she says. ""On the other hand, being uncomfortable sometimes leads to the best outcome.""
She worked three waitressing jobs in San Francisco before landing an entry-level job at the Gap, a job she says she poured everything into. After the Gap, Alber scored an entry-level role at Williams-Sonoma and worked her way up to become CEO of the company in 2010. 
Today, Alber says more than 53 percent of VP-and-above positions at Williams-Sonoma are occupied by women, and credits the company's demographic makeup to lack of biases in the hiring and promotion process. 
""You know for us, it's really about performance. It's about performance at every level and that is the only measure,"" she says. ""It's not about gender. It's not about race. It's not about sexual orientation or age. It's about performance and that's really very simple.""
She says Williams-Sonoma has been able to role model diversity throughout all levels of the company, as women hold high-level positions in engineering, products and supply chain. 
""I think you know role modeling is very important,"" she says. ""When I say that I mean having enough people, diverse people, in the company and in all levels helps other people feel comfortable."" 
Alber reveals that her personal career mantra has always been to own every position she's held and to solve any issues that will make a permanent difference in a company, an outlook that's helped her in her role as CEO.
""I think because I was able to do that and bring people along, I ended up getting bigger responsibility,"" she says. ""It was never, for me, about getting the promotion. It was about making an impact.""

SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Mexico's currency weakened against the dollar on Wednesday and stocks extended losses after Reuters reported that Canada increasingly believes that U.S. President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from NAFTA. Two government sources told Reuters they expected Trump to pull the plug at about the same time that negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico meet in late January for the sixth round of talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico's peso reversed slight gains against the dollar after the report, and was trading down around 0.4 percent. The S&P/BM IPC stock index was down about 1.8 percent, heading for its biggest loss since Oct. 25. Trump has repeatedly threatened to walk away from NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy, unless Canada and Mexico agree to major changes Washington claims are needed to make the 1994 pact more fair to U.S. workers and businesses. Yields on short-term Brazilian interest rate futures inched up on Wednesday as higher-than-expected inflation data for 2017 drove traders to trim bets on two additional interest rate cuts. Price pressures have been muted for months in Brazil, curbed growth. That may allow the central bank to keep rates at all-time lows for a long time, bolstering the economy's recovery. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.84 percent, extending losses for a second day as traders booked profits from a rally early in the year that took it to all-time highs.

3191,A tiny Nebraska startup won Trump’s first border wall contract – and that’s raising questions,"U.S. News Questions surround Trump's 1st border wall contract A tiny Nebraska startup awarded the first border wall construction project under President Donald Trump is the offshoot of a construction firm that was sued repeatedly for failing to pay subcontractors. It was also accused in a 2016 government audit of shady billing practices. The project represents a sliver of the president's plan that was central to his presidential campaign promise for a wall at the border with Mexico. It remains unclear why SWF was listed on the bid for the wall contract instead of Edgewood, New York-based Coastal Environmental Group, which online government documents list as its owner. Published 4 Mins Ago The Associated Press Mike Blake | Reuters Federal agents stand watch over U.S. President Donald Trump's eight border wall prototypes as they near completion along U.S.- Mexico border near San Diego, California, U.S., October 23, 2017. 
A tiny Nebraska startup awarded the first border wall construction project under President Donald Trump is the offshoot of a construction firm that was sued repeatedly for failing to pay subcontractors and accused in a 2016 government audit of shady billing practices. 
SWF Constructors, which lists just one employee in its Omaha office, won the $11 million federal contract in November as part of a project to replace a little more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of a current fence with post-style barriers 30 feet (9.1 meters) high in Calexico, California . The project represents a sliver of the president's plan that was central to his presidential campaign promise for a wall at the border with Mexico. 
It remains unclear why SWF was listed on the bid for the wall contract instead of Edgewood, New York -based Coastal Environmental Group, which online government documents list as its owner. 
Thomas Anderson, an Omaha lawyer who initially represented a subcontractor that sued Coastal in 2011, said he wouldn't be surprised if it was an attempt to dodge scrutiny of past legal problems. He says such a practice is relatively common in construction projects. 
""If you kick up a little dust on the trail, it makes the trail harder to follow,"" Anderson said. 
Richard Silva, who is listed in government documents as the primary contact for both SWF and Coastal, did not return numerous phone and email messages left by The Associated Press seeking comment. Messages left with a general voicemail box for Coastal also were not returned. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Fort Worth, Texas , bid the Calexico wall project, according to federal records. The agency told The Associated Press that by Thursday afternoon it would provide information on the process used to vet SWF. It didn't immediately return a follow-up call Friday seeking that information. 
In 2011, the federal government sued Coastal on behalf of Anderson's client as part of a multimillion-dollar lead cleanup project at an EPA Superfund site in northeast Omaha. The lawsuit accused Coastal of failing to pay the subcontractor, Enviroworks Inc., nearly $400,000 in labor and equipment costs and of reneging on a profit sharing agreement that cheated the subcontractor out of about $1.7 million. 
Government lawyers said Coastal's refusal to pay forced the subcontractor to lay off most of its employees. Immediately after employees were notified of the layoffs, the lawsuit alleged, ""Coastal hired and used the Enviroworks employees as its own and continued to perform the work that Enviroworks was entitled to do,"" the lawsuit alleged. 
The lawsuit was settled in 2015 for an undisclosed amount. 
In 2014, Coastal was again sued by the federal government for failing to pay another subcontractor, SF Marina Systems of Gloucester, Virginia , more than $175,000 for construction of concrete docks at the U.S. Coast Guard facility at Fire Island, New York. 
The government said that after repeated requests for payment, Coastal sent SF Marina a photocopy of a check for payment in full, along with a ""release and waiver of lien"" that Coastal said had to be signed before the check could be sent. But when SF Marina returned the signed release, Coastal still refused to pay and attempted to rely on the signed release to claim SF Marina could not collect on the debt. The lawsuit was settled in 2015, also for an undisclosed amount. 
A year later, an audit by the U.S. Interior Department found $2 million in questionable spending that should have flagged it as a problem company, but did not. 
That audit looked at billing by Coastal Environmental for work to clean up two wildlife refuges in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. The report found that Coastal billed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for labor and material, subcontractors, lodging and meals and miscellaneous items without providing supporting documents like timesheets, invoices and receipts. 
Nancy DiPaolo, with the Interior Department's Office of the Inspector General, said the department negotiated the repayment of the audit's findings to $200,000, and Coastal was given five years to pay it back. 
The audit's findings required the Interior Department to file a ""past performance report"" on Coastal that would have flagged it to other government departments, DiPaolo said. But that report was never filed, she said, for reasons she didn't know. 
""It was probably an oversight,"" she said. 
Coastal's new Omaha company, SWF, is not registered with either the Nebraska Secretary of State's office or the Nebraska Department of Labor, which is required for any company doing business within the state. Labor department officials are investigating whether SWF violated state registration requirements.",2018-03-02T23:45:00.000+02:00
6197,"As the Dow soars, technician names Apple, and two others as stocks to watch","Even as the Dow soared more than 300 points on Friday, around two-thirds of the index was trading in correction territory or worse, making picking favorites a minefield.
One technician has navigated the Dow and isolated two stocks to dodge and one to hold.
""We think you avoid J&J , avoid IBM , and you long Apple ,"" said Chris Verrone, head of technical analyst at Strategas Research Partners, on CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" Thursday.
On Apple, Verrone says the stock has based over the past 12 to 15 months and its recent breakout signals greater upside from here.
""Over the last few weeks it's been a relative outperformer in what's otherwise been a difficult tape,"" said Verrone. ""We start to get above $180, we think it targets $200. So, one of the better options there.""
Apple shares burst above $180 to an all-time high Friday, bypassing the last record set in mid-March. A move to $200 implies nearly 10 percent upside from current levels.
IBM is ""among the weaker pictures"" on the Dow, according to Verrone.
The tech company ""is in the midst of this multiyear top breaking down late last year and then rolling over here again,"" said Veronne, pegging $140 as the stock's key support. ""We don't think it holds. We think ultimately that one is headed lower.""
A sharp decline in April pulled IBM shares below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Its stock has fallen 16 percent from its 52-week high set Jan. 18.
It's a similar story on Johnson & Johnson's charts. The ""multiyear uptrend is now broken"" and it's one of the ""more broken, vulnerable names,"" said Verrone.
It's been an ugly year for J&J. The stock entered a death cross in mid-March, where its 200-day moving average moved above its 50-day moving average. That technical indicator typically signals a bearish trend.
J&J shares are down 16 percent from their 52-week high set Jan. 17. The stock has fallen 11 percent in the year to date.
Bill Baruch , president of Blue Line Futures, agrees with Verrone's bullish call on Apple and has two more names to add to the 'buy'""column.
"" Boeing and UnitedHealth can really pull some weight,"" Baruch told ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday.
His picks won't be the only ones to get a boost, according to his forecasts. The broader market should also catch a wave higher.
""I'm very bullish on the equity market in general,"" Baruch said. ""The Dow has 3 to 5 percent [upside] in the coming weeks and I think everybody's going to look back then and say, 'wow, earnings were great.'""
Stock markets have moved lower since the kickoff to the earnings season in mid-April even as companies showed off earnings growth in the double digits. The S&P 500 is essentially flat since the big banks reported earnings April 13.

Now, the level is elusive once again: 3 percent wasn't held for long, and I don't see it being revisited again anytime soon.
I'm trading 10-year Treasury futures; when the yield hit 3 percent, the price (moving inversely of yield) was at 119, a level I deemed support. I see a bullish scenario unfolding from here, with a target price of 121.
The Federal Reserve's message was relatively dovish on Wednesday, more or less signaling they're willing to allow inflation to run hot and above its 2 percent target. I view this as bullish for the futures contract.
Consider, too, that traders have amassed a record net short position in the 10-year futures, with over 1 million shorts, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Every rally starts with a short cover.
Ultimately, I feel the downside risk is limited. If everyone has already sold here, who is left to sell? If wage growth on Friday's employment report falls short of expectations, I expect the short-covering to begin.

4499,UPDATE 3-Brazil lifts embargo on some BRF plants ahead of potential EU ban,"UPDATE 3-Brazil lifts embargo on some BRF plants ahead of potential EU ban Ana Mano Reuters 
(Recasts first paragraph, adds AgMin statement, Rangel's quote, updates share price) 
SAO PAULO,   Brazil's largest chicken processor BRF SA has been allowed to resume production at nine plants that export to the European Union, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Wednesday, a day before a potential EU ban related to a food safety scandal. 
The ministry confirmed the contents of a document seen by Reuters, dated April 17, which had listed eight BRF plants as benefiting from the decision. 
The ministry clarified that one more plant had been cleared, referring to a firm appearing in the document as SHB Comércio e Indústria de Alimentos SA, which is also controlled by BRF. 
News of the decision lifted BRF's shares in early morning trade. Later in the day shares soared almost 10 percent after a news outlet reported Pedro Parente, chief executive of oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, could be the food processor's next board chairman. 
The ministry preemptively suspended production and health certification of BRF's poultry exports to the EU in mid-March due to a food safety investigation. The embargo had affected 10 production units, BRF said at the time. 
""With Europe signaling a de-listing of these (nine) slaughterhouses, and lacking technical reasons to do so, we suspended the measure,"" Luís Rangel, agriculture defense secretary, said in a statement regarding the self-embargo suspension. 
But the agriculture ministry's decision may bring only temporary relief to the company, with exports from several BRF poultry plants facing a possible ban as early as Thursday. 
A draft proposal is pending before the European Commission's standing committee on plants, animals, food and feed. The committee will determine whether ""to delist certain Brazilian establishments from which imports of products of animal origin are currently authorized."" 
Brazil's Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said the country would launch an effort to appeal the potential EU ban before the World Trade Organization. 
Maggi's frustration came after almost a month of Brazil's self-imposed embargo, when talks with the European Union ended without any guarantees that Brazilian chicken imports will be allowed in without restrictions. 
Brazil's southern Santa Catarina state, which sends 15 percent of its chicken exports to the European Union, welcomed the move. 
Three of the eight plants affected by the ministry's decision are based in the region. Santa Catarina chicken exports to Europe totaled $365 million last year, the state government said in a statement. 
""Chicken is our main export product to Europe,"" noted Airton Spies, Santa Catarina's agriculture secretary. 
BRF's Nova Mutum and Capinzal units, located respectively in Mato Grosso and Santa Catarina states, do not show up in the list of units cleared by the Brazilian government.

1154,David Rosenberg: Fed taking on role of 'serial bubble blower' and it won't 'end well',"The latest leg of the bull market in stocks could have a familiar impetus — a Federal Reserve unlikely to rock the boat, particularly while many of its members are still learning the vagaries of central banking.
With Jerome Powell about to take over as chairman and most of the seven-member Fed board of governors to be new appointees, the tendency will be toward safe decisions and away from anything likely to unsettle Wall Street, said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff.
""The bull market continues unabated and is taking on a speculative tone in the process,"" Rosenberg said in his daily note to clients Thursday. 
Those observations came the same day as stocks set still new records as the ninth anniversary of the current bull market approaches in two months. Major indexes posted gains better than 0.5 percent in afternoon trading.
In his note, Rosenberg wondered whether the Fed will ""remain a serial bubble blower."" 
The criticism is familiar: Through low interest rates and trillions of dollars in bond buying, the Fed has created a credit bubble of low-cost cash coursing through the economy and, more particularly, risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds.
Rosie Hallam | Barcroft Media | Getty Images Though the Fed has been in a slow rate-hiking pace since December 2015 — the December 2017 increase was the sixth in the current cycle — its benchmark funds rate remains targeted at just 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent.
Rosenberg said the latest run-up in stocks may be due to a market that believes the new Fed, with Powell at the helm, won't be in a hurry to raise rates. A hawkish central bank has been near the top of most Wall Street strategists' lists of what could go wrong in 2018.
""The elephant in the living room remains the central banks,"" Rosenberg wrote. ""The prevailing view is that balance sheet tapering will be mild and that Jerome Powell will prove to be a dove. This may well be the most important psychological driver for the market — that a new and inexperienced Fed will not take the punchbowl away in the coming year.""
Rosenberg, however, worries about valuations promoted by a Fed policy that is misguided particularly when it comes to inflation. The Fed's targets 2 percent inflation growth as a sign of healthy and sustainable economic growth, but has failed to reach that level despite a decade of historically accommodative policy.
While inflation is not showing up in the traditional indicators like personal consumption expenditures and the Consumer Price Index, Rosenberg said it is elsewhere — ""art, equities, corporate credit, real estate, cryptocurrencies, commodities, precious metals. Let me know if I have left anything out.""
Recent comments from investor Jeremy Grantham warning of a market ""melt-up"" or final push of cash into stocks, followed by a meltdown, caught Rosenberg's eye.
""So Jeremy Grantham could well be onto something in his recent blow-off thesis,"" he wrote. ""But he is also intimating that we are heading into the final bubble phase and those don't end well.""",2018-01-11T21:39:00.000+02:00

6959,The VA's history of setbacks and missteps,"acesA new chapter could be in store for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
On May 18, Trump announced he plans to nominate acting Secretary Robert Wilkie as permanent head of the agency.
If confirmed by Senate, Wilkie would face a long list of issues.
While the VA is rooted in noble intentions, it has been plagued with problems for years .
The VA has faced reports of excessive and contradictory spending , allegations of inadequate health care , a massive backlog of benefits claims and a top leadership position that nobody can seem to hold down .
It hasn't always been this way. The agency was elevated to federal administration status in 1930, with the intention to honor and care for the men and women who served in battle.
Since then, the U.S. has been involved in a growing list of military operations, including the 17-year-long war in Afghanistan. The VA is struggling to keep up as the need for veterans care continues to mount.
Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pedestrians walk past the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) headquarters in Washington, D.C. Some veterans can't get to care centers because they live too far away. The VA's Office of Rural Health is working to address the problem through solutions like telehealth and transportation services.
Other veterans are facing wait times of months, or even years, just to get an appointment at their VA care center. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, is trying to solve that problem in his own district. In 2015, O'Rourke introduced a proposal to improve the El Paso VA Health Care System. The VA backed the plan and approved it for a pilot test, which O'Rourke says has been going well.
And he doesn't rely on the VA itself to tell him how things are going. O'Rourke's team conducts its own annual survey to gauge how accessible the VA really is to veterans in El Paso.
""We don't trust the VA to tell us how the VA is doing, we trust veterans to tell us how the VA is doing,"" said O'Rourke, who is running to take on Republican Sen. Ted Cruz this fall.
Bill Clark | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas But the VA as a whole is still facing a long list of problems.
The benefits claims process for veterans is a bit like a game of legal ""Chutes and Ladders.""
""Veterans have heard stories, but a lot of them are surprised when they encounter the VA,"" said Jim Vale, assistant director for claims at the American Legion. ""The most important thing is to be represented.""
Fixing the VA isn't a partisan issue. It's not specific to one demographic group or geographic region. Every U.S. representative has a veteran in their district, and nobody wants to be on the wrong side of the issue.
There's a lot riding on Wilkie's nomination. The VA's new leader will be responsible for the largest integrated health-care system in the U.S., and the well-being of more than 9 million veterans.

3170,10 simple saving tricks for millennials,"If you're a millennial, you've probably heard that we have sub-par savings rates. We don't save enough for retirement , we don't save up enough to live on our own so we stay with our parents longer , and we're just all-around bad spenders .
Luckily, most of these stereotypes aren't actually true. Or, if they are, there's a good reason why.
But, for those millennials who do have a hard time saving, and don't worry, we've all been there, here are 10 tips to help you out.
1. Pick the right student credit card Many students make the mistake of waiting until after college to get their first credit card. This mean that, when it's time for them to get an apartment, they have no credit history to back them up .
The moral of the story: Don't be afraid of getting a credit card in college! In fact, credit card companies make cards just for students that make it almost impossible to overspend, and you build credit while you're at it.
Most student credit cards are secured cards, meaning they're backed up by a one-time deposit that will go towards any late payments.
show chapters Here's how this college grad saved $47,000 8:49 AM ET Fri, 24 Feb 2017 | 01:23 2. Track your credit Knowing your credit is the first step towards improving, or just understanding, your finances. If you start paying attention sooner rather than later, you'll be better off .
Luckily, there are a ton of tools to help you track your credit. There are apps, like Credit Wise from Capital One, that can show you your credit for free whether you're a Capital One customer or not. There are also Credit Karma and Credit Sesame, which are more free tracking services.
3. Open an online savings account Since nearly everything we do is online, why shouldn't your bank account (or at least one of them) be online too?
Online savings accounts are just as safe as traditional banks, and they often offer higher rates of return than the measly few cents you earn a year from your credit union.
Discover and Capital One are two of the more well-known banks that offer simple savings accounts. You can have money directly deposited into the account each month, so you don't even have to think about saving — it's done for you.

Many people swear by buying only used cars . After all, you don't have the hassle of car loan payments. Plus, you can settle for catastrophic car insurance , instead of a more comprehensive insurance that lenders require.
5. Get a side hustle The best way to save money? Earn more of it. Side hustles can go from a second, part-time job at Starbucks to selling your art on Etsy.
Or you could drive part-time for a ride-share company like Uber or Lyft. Note that, if you have an older car, that might eliminate you, since Uber likes their drivers to have newer cars. You may also not make as much as you'd think driving for a ride share company .

Saving anything , even an amount you think might be negligible, is a great place to start.
Roth IRAs are our favorite retirement accounts because of one very important feature: Your contributions and interest earnings grow tax-free and, at retirement, withdrawals are 100 percent tax-free. Roth IRAs also simply offer more freedom than an employer-sponsored 401(k) .
7. Automate your bills Forgetting to pay your bills reflects badly on your credit . Maybe not if you miss just one bill after religiously paying on time, but eventually. The point is, we all forget to write a check once in a while. Our lives are hectic and we'd rather not think about all the bills we have to pay.
Good news: You don't have to think about it. If you automate your bills, they'll be paid on time every month — and you might even get a discount. Cell phone companies and auto insurance companies often offer a few dollars off your bill each month if you automate.
8. Get rid of some of your subscriptions Long gone are the days where Netflix and Hulu were the only subscription services . Now, Amazon alone offers half a dozen different subscriptions. With automatic payments, it's easy to forget about the many services you've signed up for.
Luckily, there are easy ways to cut down on your subscriptions. Trim is just one example of the many personal finance assistant apps on the market — it lets you cancel your old subscriptions and much more.
You can also set up spending alerts for various categories and have Trim, or another app, negotiate some of your bills, so you can say goodbye to spending an hour arguing with the cable company.
show chapters This is how millennials can catch up to the boomer generation 3:00 PM ET Mon, 15 May 2017 | 00:56 9. Don't shop at high-end grocery stores Especially now that Amazon has bought Whole Foods, you might be thinking of hopping on the Whole Foods bandwagon. I have nothing against high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods or Andronico's, but they're still expensive when you consider the alternatives .
If you really want organic foods, check out your local farmer's market. They're actually cheaper than buying from high-end grocery stores and you'll get to meet the farmers in your community!
Also, ""rescue"" ugly or deformed fruit and veggies at your grocery store. They taste the same and they're a little cheaper.
Finally, try small, specialty neighborhood shops . You may have to go to the store a little more frequently, since there aren't any preservatives in some of the food, but it'll taste a lot better and you'll be supporting local businesses, and maybe getting better prices, too.
10. Get a budgeting app or journal ""Make a budget"" is probably even more annoying advice than ""contribute to your retirement plan."" But they're both important.
Making a budget isn't hard, but sticking to one is. Luckily, budgeting isn't done by hand or those boring Excel spreadsheets anymore. They can actually be fun!
There are hundreds of apps for budgeting now. Or if you're the kind of millennial who is into old fashioned things, you can try bullet journaling, which involves keeping track of your finances the old fashioned way, with pen and paper.
You'd be amazed how entertaining drawing pictures and using a bunch of different sharpies to record expenses can be.
Closing thoughts It's not actually true that millennials suck at saving , but if you need a boost anyway, these simple tricks can help. From choosing the right credit card to avoiding pricey grocery stores, there's a tip here that should work for you!

2056,Tesla expected to report earnings Wednesday after the bell,"CNBC.com Getty Images SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at the International Astronautical Congress on September 29, 2017 in Adelaide, Australia. Musk detailed the long-term technical challenges that need to be solved in order to support the creation of a permanent, self-sustaining human presence on Mars. 
Tesla reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Wednesday, and the company said it is on track to meet its Model 3 production goals. 
The company also said it delivered a record number of Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles in the quarter. 
Tesla said it posted a loss of $675 million, or $4.01 per share, in the latest quarter, its biggest loss ever. A year ago, Tesla lost $121 million, or 78 cents per share. 
After adjusting for one-time items, the company lost $513 million, or $3.04 per share. 
Tesla reported negative free cash flow of $276.7 million, compared with $1.4 billion in the previous quarter, and $969.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. 
Some analysts had expected Tesla's cash burn to slow down, but warned that it remains a risk. 
Deliveries of Tesla's higher-priced Model S and Model X vehicles grew 10 percent globally over Tesla's prior record in the third quarter, and 28 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Despite concerns Model 3 would cannibalize sales of these pricier models, Tesla said customer foot traffic has increased considerably in stores where Model 3 is on display and orders for Model S and Model X have increased. 
""There has been an even bigger increase in solar and Powerwall sales,"" Tesla said. 
Tesla opened 12 new store and service locations, for a total of 330 locations around the world at the end of 2017. Tesla increased productivity at existing service stations by 50 percent, doubling service capacity. Tesla's Mobile Service performs 30 percent of all service jobs. 
Shares of the company were flat Wednesday evening. 
Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: Adjusted loss per share: $3.04 vs. $3.12 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $3.29 billion vs. $3.28 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters 
Tesla said it is on track to meet its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the second quarter, executives said Wednesday. Tesla had originally planned to reach the target by the end of 2017, but has since moved the deadline twice. 
""We continue to target weekly Model 3 production rates of 2,500 by the end of Q1,"" the company said. 
Producing the Model 3, a sedan that starts at $35,000, on a mass market scale is widely considered crucial to Tesla's ambition of becoming a major automaker. Hopes that it will hit this target are considered one of the primary factors that have pushed Tesla's share price far above those of its much larger and profitable U.S. competitors, Ford and GM.",2018-02-07T22:37:00.000+02:00
4090,Amazon will collect sales tax for shipments to Pennsylvania as states seek to recoup billions,"Amazon has told third-party sellers that it will soon start collecting sales tax on shipments to Pennsylvania.
Starting April 1, ""Amazon will calculate, collect, and remit sales tax for orders shipped to customers"" in Pennsylvania, the company said in its seller central portal, which is only available to marketplace merchants. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the policy.
Pennsylvania is just the second state, following Amazon's home state of Washington, that's part of a new service called ""Marketplace Tax Collection,"" which CNBC reported on in November. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania passed a bill last year requiring internet retailers to charge and collect sales tax, leveling the playing field for physical stores.
Amazon is being forced to adapt to a new legislative clampdown on online sellers as more retail transactions move to the internet and states seek to recoup tax revenue. Since 1992, sales over the internet have not been subject to tax unless the merchant has a physical presence in the state of the customer. The Government Accountability Office estimated in a report late last year that state and local governments could have gained up to $13 billion in 2017 from taxes on remote sales.
show chapters Silicon Valley investor: Trump’s tweets about Amazon taxes are ‘fake news’      11:24 AM ET Wed, 28 June 2017 | 05:32 The new law in Pennsylvania requires sales tax collection regardless of whether the merchant has a physical operation in the state, so if a small clothing business in Atlanta sends a dress to Philadelphia, it now has to charge and collect the 6 percent sales tax . To date, Amazon has collected tax on items that it sells but has left it to third-party merchants on the platform to handle their own tax collection where applicable.
In addition to Washington and Pennsylvania, states including Colorado and South Dakota have passed laws compelling the collection of internet sales tax. 
On the seller central page, Amazon said that merchants don't have to take any action or pay any fees for the company's automated service, and added that there is ""currently no option to opt-out"" or ability to ""restrict sales to specific states for tax reasons.""
Whether more states follow suit may be in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. Starting in April, the high court is scheduled to hear arguments from officials in South Dakota who contend that the 1992 ruling is no longer effective given the changing state of the economy.

Bravo's ""Real Housewives of New York City"" star Bethenny Frankel has an impressive real estate resume , having owned New York digs ranging from a swanky Soho loft in Manhattan to sprawling homes in the Hamptons.
One of Frankel's purchases was famously maligned by her co-star Ramona Singer on the current season of the reality show: ""In Southhampton or any of the Hamptons, south of the highway is preferred,"" she said about Frankel's house, referring to Montauk Highway. ""Being on the highway is not south of the highway. It's just not.""
Now Frankel has listed her home at 2623 Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton with Compass Real Estate agent Caroline Sarraf for $2.995 million.
Click through the Instagram post, below, to see inside.
Nicknamed ""Morning Glory,"" Frankel purchased the house last year for $2.5 million. The transaction marked her second purchase in the posh Hamptons, and she reportedly planned to use the home as an ""investment property.""
The recently-renovated, 4,239-square-foot estate boasts seven bedrooms, five baths, a heated pool and a wrap-around porch. It sits on more than a half-acre and was built in 1910, and is listed as having a ""historic"" style. The estate also features a eat-in kitchen, a large family room with a wet bar, a formal dining room and comes furnished.
""Embracing an old world glamour rich with original period detailing and expert craftsmanship, this recently renovated and thoroughly modernized Victorian offers grand scale living in a surprisingly intimate home,"" says the Compass listing .
According to a listing for the property on Corcoran, the digs were available for rent recently, priced at rates including $150,000 for the summer, or $35,000 for June, $65,000 for July, or $85,000 for both months. It was also listed as renting for $140,000 for July to Labor Day (Sept. 3), $75,000 for August to Labor Day or $325,000 annually.
Frankel is well-known for her penchant for real estate. Although she might have expensive taste when it comes to properties (past purchases include a reported $4.995 million for a Tribeca penthouse in 2011 and a Soho space for $4.2 million in 2014), she can be frugal when it comes to interior design.
In the past, she's revealed that she likes to mix highs and lows when decorating, and has used items from affordable retailers such as Ikea and CB2 for her Tribeca house, as well as T.J. Maxx and West Elm for her first home in the Hamptons.
""I think renovating is a little bit like fashion or getting dressed and wanting to look good, but not break the bank. It's about highs and lows,"" Frankel told CNBC Make It. ""So when you get dressed, you might want to have expensive shoes, but then buy an inexpensive top from H&M.""

""Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!,'"" Trump said.
""You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!""
Tweet1 
This latest tweet comes after Trump took aim at Russia's government in a rare rebuke on Sunday, directly criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin for Moscow's support of Assad and vowing a ""big price to pay.""
Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with senior military leadership in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, April 9, 2018. Amid rumors that Washington may take military action over the chemical attack, a Russian senior official Tuesday threatened that Russia's military would shoot down any U.S. missile that entered Syrian airspace, including targeting launch sites.
""If there is a strike by the Americans then ... the missiles will be downed and even the sources from which the missiles were fired,"" Russia's ambassador to Lebanon Alexander Zasypkin told local media.
Early Wednesday morning, European air traffic control issued a public warning to airlines over the danger of air-to-ground strikes or cruise missiles when flying over the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Eurocontrol said that air strikes into Syria could take place over the next 72 hours.
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman responded to Trump's tweet: ""Smart missiles should fly toward terrorists, not legal government."" 

Forty minutes after his initial tweet, Trump posted a follow-up, describing America's relationship with Russia as ""worse now than it has ever been,"" adding that ""there is no reason for this."" He ended the tweet with what may be interpreted as a quick attempt at de-escalation: ""Stop the arms race?""
Tweet2 
Stock index futures dropped ahead of the open Wednesday after Trump's hint of possible intervention. The Dow is expected to drop more than 200 points on the back of the news. 
Trump's ""smart"" missiles line was likely in reference to Putin's claim in early March that Russia's military had developed a new prototype missile that can reach any point in the world. The claim has not been independently verified.

6397,Watch: Trump addresses criminal justice at Prison Reform Summit,"[The stream is slated to start at 11:30 a.m. ET. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]
President Donald Trump will discuss criminal justice reform in a summit at the White House on Friday.
Trump plans to address the partisan divide in Congress on improving prison conditions and better-preparing prisoners for re-entry into society at the Prison Reform Summit, bringing together more than 100 activists, experts and policymakers.
This comes as part of a push from the president's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner who proposed a prison reform bill with CNN commentator Van Jones and American Tax Reform president Grover Norquist.
The bill, the Prison Reform and Redemption Act, would require the federal prison system to evaluate inmates after sentencing and provide services to help them avoid becoming repeat offenders, including drug treatment, job training and mental health counseling.
Congress disputes have brewed over improving prison conditions, including measures regarding women's health and sanitary needs.
The House Judiciary committee cleared an act which would place federal prisoners closer to home, allow more home confinement for lower-level offenders and expand prison employment programs. The First Step Act is a follow-up to the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act passed by the committee in February.
The White House is pushing to conduct risk assessments on prisoners ready for re-entry to create customized programs to make them successful on the outside. Data-driven analysis on re-entry assessments is supported by a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, saying taxpayers could save $1.47 to $5.27 on the cost of repeated crime and incarceration.",2018-05-18T18:13:00.000+03:00

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is slated to field reporters' questions on Wednesday, following a major disruption in House leadership and a fresh crop of hawkish tweets from President Donald Trump . 
On Wednesday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis., announced that he will not seek re-election at the end of his current term . The 20-year veteran of Congress said he wanted to spend more time with his three children, all of whom were born after Ryan entered politics. 
Trump thanked Ryan for his service in a tweet shortly following the speaker's press conference. trump tweet ryan 
Ryan's announcement was preceded by a string of tweets from Trump, who touched on subjects including special counsel Robert Mueller 's probe of Russian election meddling and a possible U.S. military response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria. 
Ten minutes later, Trump warned Russia not to shoot down U.S. missiles fired at Syria ""because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'"" 
Trump said the FBI's Monday morning raid of the office and residence of his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, was ""unthinkable"" considering there is ""No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back)."" 
He then added that there is ""no reason"" for the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and Russia, which is ""worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War."" Trump blamed ""much of the bad blood with Russia"" on Mueller's investigation, contending that ""Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter)."" 
Trump's increasingly aggressive stance against Mueller trickled down to the White House press briefing yesterday, when Sanders told reporters that the administration has "" been advised that the president certainly has the power "" to fire the special counsel. 
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Trump attempted to fire Mueller in December before backing down — the second known instance of Trump trying to fire the special counsel. CNBC NEWSLETTERS

7040,"Secretary DeVos, Walmart heirs and other investors reportedly lost over $600 million on Theranos","Theranos, the blood-testing company on its way to liquidation , caused several high-profile investors to lose more than $600 million, according to a Wall Street Journal report Friday.
Documents unsealed in a lawsuit brought against Theranos reveal a number of the high profile investors who had a stake in the nearly worthless start-up: The Waltons, founders of Walmart , with $150 million; Rupert Murdoch , with $125 million; and the DeVos family, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , with $100 million. The investments were made between 2013 and 2015, according to the Journal.
While Theranos is fighting the lawsuit brought by banker Robert Colman, the company's founder Elizabeth Holmes is laying off the remaining Theranos workforce. She wrote in an April 10 email to shareholders that the company may be liquidated by August, according to the WSJ.
Brendan McDermid | Reuters Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of Theranos. Holmes settled fraud allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, agreeing to pay a $500,000 fine, give back a large portion of her Theranos shares and be barred from acting as a public company's officer or director for a decade.
The start-up made it appear as if Theranos has successfully developed a commercially-ready portable blood analyzer. In reality, the technology could only perform a small number of tests advertised.
The company had about 800 employees as recently as 2015. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal exposed Theranos' efforts to mislead investors and the public about its technology. The most recent layoff brought the head count of the failing company down to two dozen or less.

4976,Many are saying we are at 'peak earnings.' Here's why we are not,"Despite many positive signs for the economy and earnings, a small but significant group is insisting we are near ""peak earnings.""
They believe that earnings will be topping out in the next few quarters and the rate of growth in earnings will slow.
Taking their argument a step further, when the market figures this out — perhaps not this quarter but certainly within the next quarter of so — stocks will begin to droop.
How real is that concern?
""You will have more difficult comparisons in 2019,"" Christine Short, who follows corporate earnings for Estimize, told CNBC. ""The benefits from tax reform will wane some in 2019. So you may see slowing growth, but does it mean stocks will be down? Not necessarily.""
Everyone on the Street knows we are expecting phenomenal earnings growth this quarter. Estimates are looking for gains of 18.6 percent, the strongest growth since 2011.
The numbers aren't just strong for this quarter, they are strong for the whole year.
S&P 500 earnings estimates: 2018 Q1 : up 18.6 percent
Q2: up 19.8 percent
Q3: up 22.2 percent
Q4: up 19.2 percent
Source: Thomson Reuters
To be clear, 20 percent earnings growth is rarely seen.
No matter. It's all over, according to what I call the Earnings Peakers.
John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a recent note to clients: ""EARNINGS PEAK? The near 20% earnings growth rate expected for the quarter may be as good as it gets for the rest of the current business cycle (without knowing how much longer the cycle will last). Consensus estimates indicate several more quarters near that pace, but it will be difficult for companies to maintain that at this relatively late stage of the economic cycle. As 2018 progresses, market participants may start to look toward slower growth rates in 2019 when the annual bump from the new tax law will have passed and growth comparisons get more difficult.""
Part of this statement is true. Earnings growth is expected to go from 20 percent this year to ""only"" 10 percent next year. This is not a drop in earnings. Earnings would still be at record highs, but the rate of growth in earnings (the delta, as quants like to say) is slowing.
And that, Earnings Peakers say, will be enough to halt the market advance.
They got ammunition on Friday when bank earnings came in strong ( Wells Fargo missed on revenue), and the stocks sold off. Rather than ascribe it to ""sell on the news,"" which is the most likely explanation after a strong week, some insisted it was a warning sign.
Well, maybe. But my view is that several factors will likely keep stocks strong for at least the next couple of quarters.
For years, the bitter complaint among investors was that we saw earnings growth through cost cutting, and not revenue gains. That's no longer the case. Revenue has been growing for a year and is expected to continue to grow in the mid- to high-single digits for the rest of the year.
Revenue growth is only part of the ""good news"" story around stocks. It's early in the earnings season, but two stories are starting to emerge that may provide additional fuel for a stock rally: 1) growing signs that tax cuts are translating into real bottom line growth, and 2) share repurchases appear to be accelerating.
Let's talk about tax benefits first. Most companies have not reported yet, but fortunately we have a small army of analysts whose job it is to make a stab at the impact tax cuts might have on the companies they cover.
Here's the way to look at this: Total profit for the S&P 500 is expected to increase 16.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.
We don't know exactly how much of this increase is the result of tax cuts. However, if we look at estimates of earnings before interest and taxes, which removes the effect of tax payments, the S&P is expected to see an increase of 8.6 percentage points.
The difference between total profit (up 16.7 percent) and EBIT (up 8.1 percent) is roughly the effect of taxes. And that difference is 8.6 percent. For the most part, that spread historically has been fairly negligible, usually no more than 1 or 2 percentage points. But now it has jumped up significantly.
David Aurelio, who tracks corporate earnings and revenues for Thomson Reuters, believes ""the majority of this is due to tax cuts.""
That is a big difference. And most of that can reasonably be assigned to the impact of tax cuts.
""You are seeing a very strong earnings quarter on its own, but it is amplified by tax reform, and that is making it extraordinary,"" Aurelio told me.
Finally, let's look at share buybacks. Early indications are that buybacks will be up significantly this year, perhaps 50 percent or more. But once again, we can see what analysts are anticipating. Net income is expected to be up 16.7 percent, but earnings per share is expected to be up 18.5 percent.
Why is there a difference? Net income is total profit. Earnings per share is the profit allocated to each share. In theory, if net income is up 10 percent, earnings per share should be up 10 percent, unless a company is buying back shares.
If a company buys back shares, the net income stays the same, but the earnings per share goes up.
That's exactly what we are seeing. The difference between the two is 1.8 percentage points, and it is reasonable to assume that is what earnings buybacks are doing to boost earnings.
We are seeing similar numbers in quarters for the rest of the year. You may say that the markets have therefore already priced this in, but the chances are that buybacks will be increasing.
My point is that there is a good chance that tax cuts and earnings buybacks are not fully priced into the market.
Another potential help: ""Stocks were really expensive, and now the market is cheaper,"" Estimize's Short told CNBC. ""The banks are trading at 12 times forward earnings — that's a really low number. And the S&P 500 P-E ratio is below 17, which is the historical average. There's a real potential for multiple expansion. And no one has lowered earnings guidance yet,"" she said.
We may not be at peak earnings, after all.",2018-04-16T14:51:00.000+03:00

7372,"UPDATE 2-Brazil, truckers fail to reach deal to end fuel protests","UPDATE 2-Brazil, truckers fail to reach deal to end fuel protests Maria Carolina Marcello and Alberto Alerigi Published 17 Hours Ago Reuters
(Adds meeting between government and truckers group, Temer comment, soy/sugar trade group reaction, soy price move)
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, May 23 (Reuters) - A meeting between the Brazilian government and a group representing truck drivers on Wednesday failed to negotiate an end to protests over diesel prices upending numerous industries that are set to extend to a fourth day.
Road blockages have affected transportation of goods ranging from soy and auto parts to animal feed and gasoline, creating long lines at gas stations and spurring concerns that some of Brazil's busiest airports could run out of jet fuel.
The two sides met at the office of Eliseu Padilha, President Michel Temer's chief of staff, but failed to reach an accord after the government did not present a plan to reduce diesel costs, a spokesman for ABCAM, which represents the protesters, told reporters after the meeting.
Padilha, calling the meeting tense but fruitful, said there would be another meeting on Thursday. He reiterated that the government was working with congressional leaders to eliminate the CIDE tax and reduce the PIS/Cofins tax on diesel, while compensating for lost revenue with additional payroll taxes.
Temer called for ""a type of truce for two or three days at most for us to find a satisfactory solution for Brazilians and for the truckers.""
However, ABCAM said the strike will continue.
It was the first such meeting between the government and truckers since they began partially blocking roads in several states on Monday to protest surging diesel prices.
State-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Wednesday announced the second reduction this week in diesel and gasoline prices - part of the company's new policy of announcing almost daily adjustments to reflect variations in global oil prices and foreign exchange rates.
Since the truckers' protests started, Petrobras and the government have denied that there has been any political interference in the company's pricing decisions.
SOY EXPORTS AT RISK
Brazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar, most of which reach ports by road.
Concerns that the protest could halt shipments of Brazil's record soy crop have contributed to the steepest rally in soy futures in 10 months in Chicago trading, with prices up 4.5 percent in four consecutive days of increases.
Oilseed trade group Abiove said some soybean crushers were suspending operations due to the protest. Sugarcane industry group Unica said certain mills had reduced harvesting work due to short fuel supplies.
Meat processor Marfrig Global Foods SA said on Wednesday some of its plants are reducing or suspending output due to lack of deliveries during the protest.
State airport operator Infraero suggested that passengers check with airlines on the status of their flights and warned carriers to check that there is enough jet fuel to refuel planes at airports before clearing flights.
According to Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price of diesel paid by consumers. The average retail price of diesel is now 3.595 reais per liter.
Padilha said policymakers had already determined how to offset the elimination of the CIDE fuel tax, which represents about 1 percent of diesel costs. However, he said congressional leaders still had to find about 12.5 billion reais ($3.5 billion) in new revenue in order to halve for six months the PIS/Cofins tax, which makes up about 10 percent of diesel costs.
He said the Finance Ministry would also discuss with states a possible reduction of the ICMS state tax burden on diesel.
House Speaker Rodrigo Maia has said he aims to put the plan to address the truckers' concerns to a vote next Tuesday.

6489,"Retail attempts another recovery, but this one looks a little different, trader says","Retail has stanched the bleeding and is trying for a full recovery. This time it could succeed, argues one trader.
The ""XRT has actually been here before, but there are a few things going on that I think give it a better shot getting to all-time highs,"" Frank Cappelleri, senior equity trader at Instinet, said Monday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation .""
Its performance over the past year makes Cappelleri optimistic about a breakout in 2018. The XRT retail ETF was able to ""hold things together"" in 2017 even as analysts bemoaned sounds of retail's death rattle, he says.
""You heard a lot about the potential for retail to go down,"" he said. "" Amazon was taking over the world, death of retail, so forth and so on. But what happened was we were able to hold, and so right here, to me, is a very long high-level consolidation pattern.""
The XRT ETF added 2.5 percent in 2017, a fraction of the S&P 500's nearly 20 percent rise. However, its gains accelerated from 2016 and clawed back some of the losses suffered in 2015's sell-off.
Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.
Retail's recent outperformance also has Cappelleri feeling confident in a stronger push higher.
""From last fall to now, the XRT has been outperforming the S&P 500 and we're getting kind of close to pushing above this level on a relative basis,"" he explained. ""The XRT, on this daily perspective, is now forming a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern as well, which obviously push-through would get us to all-time highs.""
An inverse head-and-shoulder pattern forms when a security's price hits a low followed by a rebound, then a lower low and a rebound, and a final higher low and bounce. The pattern suggests a forming bullish trend. Cappelleri identifies a low on the XRT ETF in early March, a year-to-date low in early April and a final low later that month.
The ETF hit an all-time high of $51.25 back in March 2015, a level it tried but failed to recapture during January rallies. It currently trades under 13 percent from those records.
To Larry McDonald, editor of the Bear Traps Report, there is one corner in the space set to benefit the most from a retail resurgence: Walmart and its peers.
""Every single time we've had a late-cycle development in the markets where tech starts really taking off in that late, late cycle, that's when you see a rotation into the Walmarts, into what's called the XLP, which are the consumer staples names,"" McDonald said Monday on ""Trading Nation.""
The consumer staples sector is the worst S&P 500 performer of the year, while the information technology sector is the best. The XLP consumer staples ETF has dropped nearly 14 percent so far in 2018.
""You're going to see very shortly here in the next six months a rotation out of big tech, and that money's going to move toward consumer staples, the Walmarts of the world and retail,"" said McDonald.
The XLP ETF is down more than 2 percent in May, setting up for its fourth straight month in the red.

Bernstein | Bloomberg | Getty Images Randal Quarles, vice chairman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, speaks during a meeting with the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, May 30, 2018.
Randal Quarles , the Federal Reserve's vice chairman for bank supervision, said Thursday that the proposal to loosen restrictions on bank trading activities is just the beginning of efforts to roll back the crisis-era regulation that overhauled Wall Street.
""We have had many years of experience with this body of post crisis regulation,"" he told CNBC's Steve Liesman on Thursday during "" Power Lu nch ,"" referring to the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulations put in place in response to the financial crisis. ""There are a variety of ways we can make that regulation achieve its objective in a more efficient way.""
He added, ""We're looking closely at where we can do that.""
On Wednesday the Fed and other regulators released a proposal to loosen restrictions on bank trading activity. The so-called Volcker Rule aimed to curtain risk taking, but the banking industry has long railed against the restrictions.
""The changes that we've proposed we think will significantly reduce the burden without undermining the objective,"" Quarles said Thursday.
The rule went into effect four years ago and prevented banks from trading for their own profit or investing in hedge funds and private equity funds. The new proposal would allow banks to trade for themselves on a limited basis and would allow stakes in funds in order to hedge customer risks.

He's created the sets for award-winning musicals like ""Hamilton"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" as well as for performances from stars like Kanye West, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars.
Korins says that in order to become inspired, it's essential that he let his mind wander to the brink of boredom. Creativity, he says, is all about shutting up and letting your brain take over.
""Boredom is the moment before inspiration,"" Korins says. ""And I have tried really hard to just shut up. Just shut up. People don't do it. People don't trust silence, they don't trust boredom, they are so self-conscious…and if you just shut up, you'll have an idea.""
Technology, he explains, makes it hard to sit in a contemplative state, alone with your thoughts. But Korins urges that it's time to change that paradigm.
""You either talk to people and you build up that well of ideas, or you shut up again and think about it,"" he says. ""When was the last time you sat there and actually thought, and didn't hear that ticking clock in your head or that desire to touch your phone...and just let that wave of boredom become meditative? That moment is the one right before the light bulb goes off.""
Korins, 41, didn't get involved in set design until he was around 18, which he says was ""tremendously behind"" for the industry. He describes an environment in which his peers had grown up taking art classes, but at that point, Korins says he ""basically had never even picked up a pencil.""

Being late to the game did not deter Korins, though; he just used that as motivation to work harder. He recalls a shoe commercial that he saw when he was around 10 years old, in which a boy is dribbling a basketball in an empty gym. ""Right now,"" the commercial said, ""the other guy is practicing."" The message stuck with him.
""There were seven of us at an internship program in which I was probably the least experienced person,"" Korins tells CNBC Make It . ""I thought, 'Oh gosh, that ""right now someone else has been practicing"" thing has been true my whole life, and I've got to go make up some ground.' And so from that point, from 1997 to 2005, I did more all-nighters then any person I've ever spoken to. I would stay up all the time and work tirelessly.""
While he hustled, Korins' path to success also included some serious self-examination. In order to grow, he explains it's important to ask yourself what your true strengths and true weaknesses are, and then find people to work with who can cover your weaknesses and accentuate your strengths.
""I really had to think, 'What do I do better than any of my peer groups?'"" Korins says, adding that you also have to be careful about who you're comparing yourself to. David Korins Design
""I had someone in my life tell me, 'Look outside, look at all the buildings. Every one of those buildings is owned by somebody. In 30 years, every one of those buildings will be owned by somebody else. You cannot compare yourself to someone 30 years in front of you. You can compare yourself to your peer group, but you have to be honest about those comparisons,"" he explains.
""I realized pretty early on in my career, that probably within my peer group, I was somebody that might be lucky enough and ambitious enough and connected enough and good enough at a job to get a building,"" he says. ""The question was, what neighborhood would that building be in, how tall would that building be, how fancy...and would it be a building that I wanted to live in?""
Korins is now one of the most–decorated set designers working on Broadway, and his current projects include the scenic design for the new, highly-anticipated ""Beetlejuice"" musical .
While his sets have been nominated for Tony Awards and won an Emmy, he says his greatest work so far has been building David Korins Design, which he founded in 2004. The experiential design firm's credits include everything from Broadway blockbusters to restaurants like Manhattan's Bond 45 and commercials for Target.
""The project I'm most proud of is building this business,"" Korins says. ""My work is made possible by an incredibly talented, totally committed, ferociously loyal — [and it's] phenomenally humbling that they all show up — group of people."" CNBC
Though Korins' success is certainly a testament to hard work, his advice to 20-somethings striving for success is to strike a balance between working hard to push your career forward and finding new ways to explore life.
""Your imagination is like a fountain,"" Korins explains. ""Any time you travel anywhere or read a book or see something, you fill up that water level a little bit so that the fountain can work beautifully. And then you work, and you use those ideas and the fountain depletes. And you've got to fill that fountain up. [Your] 20s is that decade when you should fill it and fill it and fill it, so that when you really get the opportunity to use your ideas, they're full.""",2018-04-30T22:26:00.000+03:00
6294,'Shark Tank' entrepreneurs from ‘Getaway’ reflect on their time in the tank,"Need to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life?
With Getaway 's tranquil tiny home business , your secret escape hatch is only a text message away. CEO Jon Staff and co-founder Pete Davis appeared on Shark Tank in hopes of turning their Brooklyn-based business from an exciting new concept to a national phenomenon.
They pitched Getaway to the Shark Tank panel seeking a $500,000 investment for 5 percent of their company. Now, Jon Staff is opening up about their time in the tank and where Getaway stands today.
Getaway Staff said before facing the panel, his team ""put in a lot of work in an attempt to not embarrass ourselves on national television."" But when the Sharks started questioning Getaway's $10 million valuation price, their pitch got away from them.
According to Staff, ""Everything was moving so fast that it was hard to keep our thoughts straight. The result was an easy opening for Chris and the others to (rightfully!) give us grief.""
The Getaway team might have received a grilling, but they didn't walk away defeated. If anything, the Sharks' skepticism taught them a valuable lesson about ""being a weird business that not everyone gets."" Staff says, ""For innovative ideas, fundraising and picking partners, it's a lot more about finding people who connect to the common vision than about how much money they can bring to the table.""
Once they meet their financial goals, Getaway has big dreams for its business. They're aiming to expand to six markets across the United States, but don't want to rush it.
""It takes a lot of time to make sure we're picking good locations, to build our tiny cabins and to make sure our experience as a whole is just the way we want them,"" Staff explained.
Staff and Davis ended up walking away from an low-ball offer from billionaire Shark Chris Sacca . That said, the exposure Getaway received on Shark Tank has helped them grow exponentially within their current markets.
""When we did the show, we had ten tiny cabins outside of Boston and New York. Today we have 75 combined in New York, Boston, and DC. And we are well on our way to more,"" he added.

6065,Oil traders and insurers are the latest weapons in UN efforts to enforce North Korea sanctions,"For some deliveries to the Far East, the UN now wants the companies to require supporting documents that would prove deliveries of certain petroleum products have not been diverted to North Korea.
The so-called end-use verification requirement would give some sanctioned products the same treatment as arms shipments.
""It's just like with weapons,"" Hugh Griffiths, coordinator of the UN's North Korea panel, said in an exclusive interview with CNBC. Griffiths said that the few extra contract clauses would be ""a simple thing any company can handle.""
Another UN proposal asks the companies to ensure through their contracts that the vessels keep their tracking systems switched on at all times.
The tracking beacons, known as ""automatic identification systems,"" play a crucial role in monitoring illegal trades at sea. To circumvent the UN's strict quotas on deliveries of petroleum products to North Korea — or the outright ban on buying North Korean coal — vessels will turn off their AIS beacons when they rendezvous with North Korean ships for offshore trades.
In every case of ship-to-ship trades with North Korea, Griffiths said, ""the vessels switch off their AIS just before they meet at sea, meaning that they cannot be tracked any longer."" Griffiths called the blackouts ""an immediate risk indicator.""
He added: ""If a vessel switches off its AIS at sea, there is a heightened risk that it's doing something clandestine or illegal."" Targeting incentives
The UN is targeting insurance companies and commodity traders in these transfers for effectiveness and simplicity.
Griffiths said only about 10 insurance and reinsurance companies and a similar number of commodity traders connected to the ships are making hidden trades with North Korea.
More importantly, Griffiths said, ""All the ships that have been involved in these illicit ship-to-ship transfers ... have Western reinsurance."" Ship captains, who need insurance to operate, would be placing their careers at risk if they defied their insurance contracts by switching off their AIS trackers. Kevin Breuninger | CNBC CNBC’s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera views maritime intelligence software programs with United Nations North Korea panel coordinator Hugh Griffiths at Two United Nations Plaza on May 4, 2018.
The entities skirting the sanctions on North Korea have taken advantage of an increasingly globalized trade landscape, prompting the UN to seek solutions that create incentives for companies to comply with new restrictions, Griffiths said.
He said the sanctions ""are working better than they've ever worked before"" — but even still, ships are going dark.
Among the only reason that a vessel's tracker could be appropriately disabled, Griffiths said, would be to mitigate the threat of alerting pirates of its position.
That loophole could create problems when targeting North Korea because the country's vessels ""are now behaving a bit like pirates,"" Griffiths said, by disguising their ships, sailing under false names and hiding their tracking numbers.
""So it's just possible in theory that a captain approaching a North Korean tanker might think he's dealing with a vessel belonging to another country,"" Griffiths said. Going dark
Even as Kim's authoritarian regime appears to be taking steps to thaw its hostile relations with other world powers, Griffiths said UN member states have been able to monitor five to 10 sanction-defying trades each month.
As long as the ships continue to switch off their trackers, it's extremely difficult for the UN to monitor the petroleum product trades.
""It's impossible to physically detect these transfers because they switch off their AIS and they go dark and we can no longer see what they're doing,"" Griffiths said.
As for North Korea itself, Griffiths said the country still regards the Security Council as illegitimate.
""North Korean tankers are now always dark,"" Griffiths said.
The most recent report from the council's panel of experts on North Korea concluded that the country made $200 million in ship-to-ship transfers in the first nine months of 2017.
Griffiths said that despite North Korea's sudden warmth toward its southern neighbor, the transfers have continued. He said his team has witnessed a $40 million transfer in just one network within the past six months.
And even with an increase in talk of peace initiatives — including the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump — Griffiths isn't so sure that denuclearization is on the way.
The UN coordinator noted that Kim, in his 2018 New Year's address, said that sanctions were indeed having an effect. ""But another thing he talked about was the mass production of nuclear weapons. And that is something that is extremely difficult for our panel to track, and it's something I'm concerned about,"" Griffiths said.
Nuclear missile launch tests are understandably easy to track. But the assembly of nuclear weapons, which could be taking place in covered or underground facilities, is far more difficult to monitor.
""Some of this is above my pay grade,"" Griffiths cautioned, ""but I think [with] the statements made by chairman Kim Jong Un about mass production, it would be very important to get into these sites and to see what's happening there.""

6616,ANALYSIS-Brazil ethanol sales to Japan to sputter as Tokyo woos Trump,"ANALYSIS-Brazil ethanol sales to Japan to sputter as Tokyo woos Trump Marcelo Teixeira Published 12 Hours Ago Reuters
SAO PAULO, April 30 (Reuters) - Brazil ethanol producers stand to lose a big chunk of their largest market, Japan, to U.S. agribusiness, after Tokyo bent to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and tweaked requirements for gasoline additives.
Until recently, nearly all the ethanol used to make ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) for Japanese consumption has come from Brazil, whose sugarcane-based ethanol boasts lower emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than U.S. ethanol made from corn.
But in mid-April, Japan's government loosened emissions requirements on ETBE while its prime minister was visiting the United States. Brazilian cane industry group Unica accused Tokyo of backsliding on environmental controls.
But American ethanol producers cheered the move, a rare trade victory for U.S. farmers who have suffered much of the blowback from Washington's escalating trade row with China.
""For the first time, the U.S. ethanol industry will have the opportunity to compete for a portion of Japan's fuel blending market,"" said Emily Skor, head of Washington-based ethanol group Growth Energy, in a statement.
CASUALTIES
Brazilian cane producers are the latest casualties in a trade dispute kicked off by Trump last year.
China boosted imports of Brazilian soybeans and threatened tariffs on U.S. soybeans. Steep duties on U.S. sorghum imports made shippers find new homes for 20 bulk vessels worth more than $200 million that were already en route to China.
Japan's new ethanol rules started with a public consultation last year to review fuel blending standards.
However, a senior Brazilian diplomat said on condition of anonymity that Brasilia had expected the move as a way for Japan to ease Trump's concerns about that country's trade surplus with the United States.
""Due to the large U.S. trade deficit, it was clear that ethanol could be one of those products used to reduce the imbalance,"" the diplomat said.
Japan consumes nearly 45 percent of Brazil's ethanol exports, or about 800 million liters annually, including the volumes used for ETBE, much of which is made by U.S. producers.
Much of the ETBE used in Japan is already made in the United States using Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, so the new rules should make it easy for producers to switch quickly to U.S. corn-based sources.
A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report said the Japanese policy change could create a market opportunity for U.S. ethanol producers of 366 million liters, valued at around $170 million.
""In the end, whatever you take away from Brazil you give to the U.S.,"" an ethanol export trader said.
The shift adds to rising tension in the ethanol industry. Last year, Brazil slapped a 20 percent tariff on U.S. exports in an effort to slow south-bound flows.
Even with the tariff, U.S. ethanol exports hit a record high in February, thanks largely to rising Brazilian demand as higher gasoline prices and low international sugar prices made ethanol more competitive at the pump.

4736,"As oil surges, a death cross may be forming on the chart of energy stocks","21 Hours Ago | 03:17 
Oil may be rocketing to its highest level in more than three years , but an ominous pattern forming in the energy sector has one strategist feeling cautious. 
""We're very close to a death cross in the XLE ,"" Matt Maley , equity strategist at MillerTabak, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Tuesday. ""In the XLE, it is usually, almost always, a very compelling move. … The last time we've had death crosses it's been followed by 10 to 20 percent sell-offs."" 
A ""death cross"" charts when a 50-day moving average crosses below a 200-day moving average. The technical indicator can be used to forecast potential downside in an asset. 
While Maley says he's not a devotee of the indicator, it does historically portend trouble for energy stocks when it happens in the XLE energy ETF. When the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day toward the end of 2014, the XLE ETF did not find a bottom until it had dropped by more than 40 percent. 
Energy stocks can avoid such a fate this time if they manage to rally and hold any gains, says Maley. 
""If we can get a nice breakout here, we can avoid the cross and that would be quite positive,"" he said. ""I've been quite bullish on the group and think it will play catch up, but that one little technical development is starting to get me a little bit worried."" 
The XLE's 50-day moving average fell below its 200-day at the beginning of the week. The ETF is currently trading around 4 percent above its 50-day and 3 percent above its 200-day. 
Another analyst says the unknowns in the industry are still far too great for him to be optimistic on energy stocks. 
""There's too much uncertainty surrounding the sector right now as well as a lot of volatility in general markets due to geopolitical concerns,"" Michael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors, said on ""Trading Nation."" ""That's going to weigh on the oil and the whole industry."" 
Crude oil prices, and energy stocks, have spiked this week as President Donald Trump considered the degree of U.S. military intervention in the Syrian civil war, especially after an alleged chemcial weapons attack by the government. Separately, Saudi Arabia said it intercepted three ballistic missiles headed to Riyadh on Wednesday in a suspected attack from Yemen's Houthis. The threat of broader contagion from both conflicts in the Middle East could choke off oil supply in the region. 
The XLE ETF is up nearly 5 percent this week, while West Texas Intermediate crude has added more than 7 percent. The XLE remains 2 percent lower for the year even though crude has increased 10 percent.",2018-04-11T20:53:00.000+03:00
7356,Comedian Samantha Bee used a vulgar insult to describe Ivanka Trump – and now she's apologizing,"Comedian Samantha Bee apologized Thursday for using vulgar language to describe Ivanka Trump , President Donald Trump 's elder daughter and a top White House aide.
In a tweet, Bee said she ""crossed a line"" when she used the expletive on her TBS comedy show, ""Full Frontal,"" calling it ""inappropriate and inexcusable.""
@iamsambee: I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.
The incident comes on the heels of ABC canceling ""Roseanne,"" after Roseanne Barr compared black Obama aide Valerie Jarrett to an ape. While the actress later apologized for her remarks , Barr also retweeted messages supporting her tweet that led to the cancellation of her show.
On Wednesday night, Bee called the president's daughter a ""feckless c---"" during her show. The comedian used the slur as she urged Ivanka Trump to talk to her father about immigration policies that separate children from their parents .
""Let me just say, one mother to another, do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c---! He listens to you,"" Bee said. ""Put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to f---ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes, OK?""
TBS said in a statement that it regrets airing that language.
In the fallout, AutoTrader.com said it was suspending its sponsorship of ""Full Frontal"" after Bee's use of ""offensive and unacceptable language.""
@AutoTrader_com: Thank you to those who reached out regarding our sponsorship of Full Frontal. The comments expressed by Samantha Bee were offensive and unacceptable and do not reflect the views of our company. As a result, we have suspended our sponsorship of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.
First lady Melania Trump also ripped the media, accusing the press of an ""astounding"" double standard.
""Time and again the Trump family and members of this Administration are subjected to false reporting, hateful rhetoric and outrageous lies all in the name of freedom of speech or comedy, yet the main stream media stays silent,"" she said in a statement.
Over the years, Donald Trump has rarely apologized for his use of derogatory and crude remarks in describing women. Trump said then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly had ""blood coming out of her whatever"" when she challenged his language toward women during the first Republican primary debate.
He did apologize, however, for crude comments he made in 2005 to Billy Bush about groping women after a tape of the conversation was made public during the final stretch of the 2016 campaign.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Bee's language was ""vile and vicious.""
""The collective silence by the left and its media allies is appalling. Her disgusting comments and show are not fit for broadcast, and executives at Time Warner and TBS must demonstrate that such explicit profanity about female members of this administration will not be condoned on its network,"" Sanders said in a statement.",2018-05-31T22:36:00.000+03:00
2385,"Gold hasn't acted like a safe-haven in Wall Street's turmoil, but here's why it may revert to form","22 Hours Ago | 01:19 
All that glitters certainly wasn't gold this week, with the traditionally safe-haven asset sinking amid Wall Street's massive sell-off. 
But one longtime gold watcher says now could be the time to buy — if you are a patient investor. 
""Give it a little bit of time,"" Mike Dudas, partner at Vertical Research, told CNBC's "" Futures Now "" this week. ""We've just come off a tumultuous last four or five days in the equity markets and everything's getting re-based."" 
The inverse relationship between stocks and gold should reestablish itself as volatility returns and erratic moves become more commonplace, predicted Dudas. The Cboe Volatility Index ( VIX ), which measures market volatility, spiked on Monday to its highest settlement since 2011. Three months earlier, the index had settled at an all-time low. 
""As things settle down and we get much more volatility in the marketplace, I think gold is going to find a bid,"" he said. "" With the advent of the short-vol trade being busted, more equity volatility, bond markets moving higher with inflation expectations increasing, I think that's very important."" 
In the near term, Dudas forecasted an upside target of $1,355 an ounce for gold. He maintained a year-end price target of $1,400. Such a level implies 6 percent upside from current levels. 
Gold prices declined by nearly 2 percent in the month so far, failing to find buyers already fleeing sharp sell-offs in the stock market. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 1,000 points on Monday and Thursday, gold prices saw moves of less than 1 percent. Not a good week for gold or stocks 
This week, the Dow's worst since crisis-stricken 2008 , gold has also dropped in its worst performance of the year. This marks its second week in a row that blue chip stocks ended in the rred. 
Recently, bullion has underperformed markedly when compared to other periods of market duress. During the 2008 crisis when the S&P 500 Index lost 57 percent in market capitalization, gold rose 24 percent. Earlier, in the bear market from 2000 to 2002, the S&P lost 49 percent while gold added nearly 13 percent. 
Indiscriminate pressure across commodities likely spilled over into gold trade during this unusual period, Dudas told CNBC. A commodities sell-off has wiped out year-to-date gains for crude oil, also sending copper and silver prices lower. 
""The fundamentals are good,"" but investors appear overstretched on some of their bets, and are adding to the selling pressure, Dudas explained. That re-positioning ""could limit some of the upside in some of the commodities,"" said Dudas. 
Gold prices are up just 0.7 percent so far this year, while crude has fallen 2 percent, copper 7 percent, and silver 5 percent.",2018-02-10T23:09:00.000+02:00

5759,An energy darling made a big move in the hottest US oil region — and investors dumped its stock,"CNBC.com Brittany Sowacke | Bloomberg | Getty Images A worker prepares to lift drills by pulley to the main floor of a drilling rig in the Permian basin. 
Concho Resources , one of Wall Street's favorite oil drillers, recently announced a deal that would make it the biggest player in the nation's hottest region — and investors have been dumping the stock ever since. 
The selling has lopped nearly $2.6 billion off the market capitalization of a company valued at $23.4 billion prior to the announcement. 
Concho has long stood out among its peers for its ability to fund its capital spending program with cash generated from its business operations. It's a rare feat in the debt-fueled, growth-oriented world of frackers, the class of drillers that specializes in extracting oil and gas from shale rock through a process called hydraulic fracturing. 
But the Street has soured on Concho since it announced last week it would buy fellow Permian fracker RSP Permian in a deal worth $9.5 billion. The move, Concho says, ""creates the largest crude oil and natural gas producer from unconventional shale in the Permian Basin."" 
The case illustrates just how wary investors have become about independent drillers seeking growth at the potential expense of shareholder value. 
Shares of Concho are down 11 percent since the announcement on March 28. Over the same period, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF — an exchange traded fund that tracks Concho's peer group — is up 3.5 percent. 
In a sign of its recent reversal of fortune, Concho's stock price was up 9.7 percent over the last year, while the ETF was down 3.5 percent. Concho posted the best 12-month performance after ConocoPhillips and Hess among drillers in the S&P 500 Energy sector. 
Stifel analysts said the investor reaction may simply boil down to ""sticker shock and sheer surprise."" 
The deal pencils out to about $72,000 per acre, a hefty sum even in the Permian Basin, a prolific oil and natural gas-producing region in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. The relatively low cost of drilling shale rock there sparked a land rush in 2016 as frackers sought out acreage that could help them weather a period of weak oil prices. 
Investors were also caught off guard by the nature of the deal, Stifel says. In the past, Concho has negotiated privately to buy non-public companies in deals that immediately add value to its stock. 
""In recent years, the playbook has become increasingly more difficult to execute based on the improving quality of CXO's portfolio and the deteriorating quality of remaining private acreage,"" Stifel said in a research note. show chapters 3:12 PM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 02:37 
The critical question for Stifel is whether the cost savings that result from combining the two drillers will offset the $1.8 billion premium it paid for RSP Permian . Stifel thinks it can hit its goal of saving $2 billion. 
Piper Jaffray's Simmons & Company said investors might be punishing Concho simply because it didn't offer enough specific, transparent guidance on how it plans to achieve that $2 billion in savings. 
The energy-focused investment bank says it's fair to say the deal is expensive on a per-acre basis. However, Simmons believes the purchase will ultimately boost cash flow, a critical measure of financial health in the oil patch. 
Some critics also argue Concho didn't need the additional inventory. But Simmons is in Concho's corner on that count, too, saying it has earned the benefit of the doubt given its history of prioritizing its best acreage during tough times, as well as the increased scale and cost savings that a combination will create. 
""Notably, the investment community has consistently espoused the merits of consolidation within a highly fragmented business in which operators should benefit from increased scale, scope and combined operating synergies,"" Simmons said. 
Keybanc analysts say some investors appear to be questioning whether the sticker price will make it difficult to wring value out of the purchase. In Keybanc's view, the deal will boost the combined company on most measures of value. 
In a research note, the Keybanc analysts say they ""see a stronger Company emerging that should warrant a continued premium multiple.""",2018-04-06T18:57:00.000+03:00

2976,"Tillerson rips DC as 'a very mean-spirited town' after brief, bitter tenure as secretary of State","He came, he saw, he got fired on Twitter. And now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said farewell, with a parting plea Thursday to America's diplomats not to let anyone violate their integrity.
Tillerson did not mention his erstwhile boss, President Donald Trump, as he spoke to several hundred State Department workers who gathered at headquarters in Foggy Bottom to watch him depart. Nor did he directly address the icy manner in which he was terminated last week after one of the shortest stints by a secretary of state in recent history.
""This can be a very mean-spirited town,"" Tillerson said, eliciting laughter at first and then applause. ""But you don't have to choose to participate in that.""
When he arrived in the nation's capital last year, Tillerson made no secret of his unwillingness to play the Washington-style games that turn governing into blood sport: one-upmanship, aggressive public posturing, surreptitious leaking and even sabotage. Weeks into his tenure, the Texas oilman famously declared he wasn't big on press access, explaining, ""I personally don't need it.""
show chapters Tillerson departure 'very concerning': Bill Richardson      4:04 PM ET Tue, 13 March 2018 | 02:16 Others in Trump's administration didn't see it the same way, and Tillerson quickly found himself on the receiving end of negative reports, leaks from his rivals and mounting speculation about his future until being abruptly fired last week, four hours after returning from Africa. Often at odds with the White House, he also lost the confidence and support of many of the State Department's 75,000 workers over his moves to cut the budget, leave key leadership positions vacant and downplay human rights and democracy-promotion as diplomatic priorities.
Still, there was sustained applause for several minutes as he departed the marbled lobby of the Harry S. Truman Building, the same lobby where the former Exxon Mobil CEO introduced himself as ""the new guy"" in his hallmark Texas drawl 14 months ago. A few former staffers whose tenures were even shorter than Tillerson's also returned to see him off.
Then Tillerson set off for his home in Texas — ""a more familiar climate,"" Deputy Secretary John Sullivan joked, ""which I know suits him well."" If the Senate agrees, he will soon be replaced by current CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who frequently bumped heads with Tillerson over Iran and other issues.
""Never lose sight of your most valuable asset, the most valuable asset you possess: your personal integrity,"" Tillerson says. ""Only you can relinquish it or allow it to be compromised. Once you've done so, it is very, very hard to regain it. So guard it as the most precious thing you possess.""

488,"Bank of America, Citigroup reviewing the use of credit cards to buy bitcoin","Friction is increasing between some credit card companies and customers who want to use the cards to buy cryptocurrencies. 
Bank of America and Citigroup are reviewing policies that allow customers to buy bitcoin with credit cards . The reviews follow news about two weeks ago that Capital One Financial has decided to prohibit cryptocurrency purchases.
CapOneTweet 
Toronto-Dominion Bank subsidiary TD Bank also confirmed to CNBC that some bitcoin transactions aren't being processed as the result of security measures.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Bank of America's cryptocurrency review Thursday. Discover Financial Services effectively prohibited cryptocurrency purchases with its credit cards in 2015, the Journal said. Discover did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Money laundering appears to be a factor in the financial firms' concerns about dealing with cryptocurrencies. Discover CEO David Nelms said in a Bloomberg report Wednesday that financing purchases of cryptocurrencies creates headaches for banks that are required to monitor transactions for money laundering.
Earlier this month, Visa also ended its relationship with cryptocurrency card company WaveCrest, which allows people to convert their cryptocurrencies into cash loaded onto a prepaid card. 
Jamie Dimon's J.P. Morgan Chase is still allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies with their Chase credit cards, the bank told CNBC. However, Chase did not respond to a question about potential changes to that policy.

1843,"Earnings are up and revenue growth is back, but rate hikes could derail momentum","Half of the S&P will have reported by the end of the day Friday, and it is turning into an extraordinary quarter. Earnings are up nearly 14 percent from last year ago, and they keep rising, according to Thomson Reuters.
That is a blended estimate and includes companies that have not reported yet. Counting just the companies that have already reported, earnings are up 15.3 percent.
Far more companies are beating estimates (nearly 80 percent) than the average (64 percent), and they are beating by a wider margin.
Most importantly, revenue growth has returned. The earnings gains are no longer coming primarily from cost cutting. Revenue growth is at 7.7 percent, near the highest in years. In addition, 82 percent of companies are beating the revenue estimates (also far higher than the 60 percent average). As they have done with earnings, companies are beating the estimates by a wider margin, 6.1 percent. That is also about twice the average of 3.1 percent.
The ""reflation trade,"" or the bet on an expanding global economy, can be seen in the estimates for cyclical companies. There is notable growth in estimates for materials, 31.6 percent, energy, 139.6 percent, and industrials, 6.8 percent. Excluding GE , industrials would see growth of 15.9 percent.
First-quarter earnings estimates have also been rising.
Q1 Earnings estimates
Oct. 1: up 10.6 percent
Jan. 1: up 12.2 percent
Feb. 2: up 14 percent
Of course, these numbers will eventually level off, but what is remarkable is analysts are expecting double-digit earnings growth in the next four quarters across the board: in the S&P Small Cap 600, the S&P Midcap 400 and the S&P 500.
What could derail this gravy train? Friday's jobs report, which indicates that wages have grown 2.9 percent year over year, the strongest since 2009. While that is good news for American workers, it is causing agita for traders.
The market has not been freaked out about higher interest rates, but beginning in mid-January, the velocity of change in rates began to accelerate. We went from 2.5 percent in the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.8 percent in about three weeks, and that is a bit too fast for traders. They are being forced to adjust their thinking about the number of possible Fed rate hikes this year from three to possibly four.
""This wage number will be looked upon as supporting those looking for four hikes this year,"" independent bond analyst Adrian Miller told me.",2018-02-02T17:06:00.000+02:00
1734,"No need to panic, analysts say, after Dow swings 1,600 points in one day","19 Hours Ago | 05:24 
Monday's session was one for the history books. 
At its worst, the Dow Jones swung close to 1,600 points lower in the largest ever intraday point decline. 
To Michael Bapis, managing director at The Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors, the sell-off will be proven meaningless in the long term. 
""This is just a little blip on the radar,"" he told CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" ""This breather is healthy. Stay the course."" 
Benchmark indexes plummeted during Friday's and Monday's sessions — the Dow shed more than 1,800 points while the S&P 500 lost $1.5 trillion in market cap. The two-day sell-off was blamed on Friday's jobs report, which showed stronger-than-expected wage growth, a development that extended a bond rout and raised expectations for a more hawkish Federal Reserve . 
Wall Street's two-day sell-off came as a shock to markets inured to record highs and steady gains. The S&P 500 and Dow ended January with their best monthly rises in 22 months. It was also their best start to the year since the '90s. 
""I think what happened was the market went too far, too fast,"" said Matt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""Momentum-driven trades took the market higher than it should have gone given the tax breaks. … You've got to calm down a little bit. Some of this is artificial moves."" 
Wall Street's recent swings are an uncommon sight after years of low volatility. Before Friday, the Dow had not seen a decline of more than 500 points since June 24, 2016, when a surprise ""yes"" Brexit vote rocked global markets. On Monday, the S&P 500 snapped its longest streak on record without a 5 percent correction, an achievement it made last October. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images A monitor displays stock information on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Monday, Feb. 5, 2018. U.S. stocks plunged, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average down almost 1,600 points, as major averages erased gains for the year. 
Volatility, as measured by the VIX, roared higher on Monday as panicked selling and algorithm-driven trades caused the Dow to drop hundreds of points within minutes. The VIX surged nearly 115 percent, exceeding 37, its highest level since August 2015. Just three months ago, the measure sank to its lowest level on record. 
The day's losses were enough to erase all year-to-date gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. The S&P 500 is now down 0.9 percent in 2018 and has pulled back 8 percent from its all-time closing high set on Jan. 26. The Dow ended the session with yearly losses of 1.5 percent and has gapped 8.5 percent from its high set on the same day just over a week ago. 
The Dow and S&P 500 are still another drop away from correction territory, but Friday's and Monday's losses did drag down more than 75 S&P 500 companies at least 10 percent from their 52-week highs. Chesapeake Energy , Tractor Supply , EQT Corp. and Metlife were some of the worst performers, having dropped more than 15 percent from recent all-time highs. 
Until we get a bounce, Bapis encourages investors to look to earnings health and the strength of the economy as reasons to hold off on getting caught up in the panic. 
""The future is strong earnings. The future is positive for stocks right now. The future is positive for the economy,"" Bapis told ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""Let's keep it long term and let's refocus where the attention should be."" 
Just over half of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings so far this season with the majority besting estimates. Of those that have reported, 78 percent have exceeded profit consensus, while 80 percent have topped revenue expectations, according to Thomson Reuters.",2018-02-06T14:15:00.000+02:00
2911,China's alleged intellectual property theft a bigger threat to market than tariffs: Analyst,"There's a bigger threat to the market than President Donald Trump 's new tariff proposal, strategist Jeffrey Schulze told CNBC on Friday.
The president said Thursday he wants to impose a 10 percent tariff on aluminum and a 25 percent tariff on steel.
""We have a much more important ruling that's going to be coming out"" regarding allegations that China has stolen intellectual property from U.S. companies, the chief investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments said in an interview with "" Power Lunch .""
Fred Dufour | AFP | Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump has said in the past that he's considering a big fine as part of the probe into China's alleged theft. 
While Trump did not specify what he meant by a ""fine"" against China, the 1974 trade law that authorized an investigation into China's alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property allows him to impose retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods or other trade sanctions until China changes its policies.
If the Chinese are found guilty, Schulze fears that the nation will retaliate.
""That ruling is going to weigh on investor sentiment right now for the next month. And until we get a little bit of visibility there, I think the markets are going to be trading in a choppy pattern,"" he said.
The market sold off on Thursday after Trump's tariff announcement, with fears of a potential trade war weighing on investors. On Friday, however, stocks closed higher . 
""Does this evolve into a full-fledged trading war? Because then you go way beyond steel,"" Prudential Financial chief investment strategist Quincy Krosby told ""Power Lunch.""
""The answer is we just don't know. And markets do not like the uncertainty,"" she added.
Jack Bouroudjian, chief economist and co-founder of UCX, said if the tariffs expand into more widespread protectionism, the U.S. won't be happy with the results.
""Protectionism is a prosperity killer, plain and simple,"" he said in an interview with "" Closing Bell .""

3219,Saudi Arabia's stock market could get a liquidity boost that would aid an Aramco listing,"Saudi Arabia's stock market could get a helpful boost of liquidity, if it is included in emerging markets indexes ahead of its anticipated IPO of state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.
The kingdom's equities market is being considered by MSCI for emerging markets status, and also by the FTSE Russell for its list of emerging markets. The latter could be announced Wednesday, if Saudi Arabia is approved. MSCI's announcement, a much bigger driver of emerging market funds, is due in June.
""It would introduce more liquidity into the markets, and we're talking about an IPO of a state-owned company, which would be a large contributor to the market. Anything that would make the market bigger, the pool bigger would help absorb the IPO,"" said Peter Donisanu, global market strategist at Wells Fargo.
A FTSE Russell spokewoman said there will be an announcement after the U.S. close Wednesday.
""People are anticipating anywhere from from $3 to $5 billion of international flows will come into the stock market prior to MSCI, FTSE inclusion. On the back of that, you have a lot of locals who are beginning also to invest in the stock market. That's keeping up the momentum. The stock market is roughly by now about 10 percent lower than where it was the last time oil prices were at $70,"" said John Sfakianakis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center.
He said there are estimates that MSCI inclusion would bring in another $15 to $20 billion of foreign inflows. The widely held iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is based on MSCI, and managers who use MSCI indexes would have to add Saudi shares if it is approved.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, has been in the U.S. and is visiting with government officials and business leaders, as part of his efforts to change Saudi into a more diverse, modern economy. On Tuesday evening, the prince announced, along with Softbank , a plan to build the world's largest solar power generation project.
Sarah Al-Suhaimi, chairwoman of the bourse, or the Tadawul, told CNBC Tuesday that the exchange has been transforming itself, in areas such as clearing, in line with international standards. She was attending the Saudi-U.S. CEO forum in New York.
The Aramco IPO is expected to list first on the Saudi exchange and has been targeted for 2018, though it could be later in early, 2019.
On the local exchange, ""they could test the waters a little bit, see what investor appetite is. If its true this FTSE and MSCI litings come through, you could have a lot more buyers at the table,"" said Donisanu.
He said the overall Saudi market has a market cap of about $450 billion, and the IPO listing there would have to be smaller than the $100 billion the company hopes to raise globally.
The company has also been considering listing in Hong Kong, London or New York which would come after the Riyadh listing.
Nishit Lakhotia, head of SICO told CNBC earlier Wednesday that he expects to see the FTSE Russell listing to be announced. ""In terms of the flows, yes the market is factoring it in,"" he said. ""This should go ahead, very likely today and if you look at the flows and the expected flows from the inclusion, it will be much more than what's already happened. This is much more of a speculative rally.""
Lakhotia said the passive flows from the FTSE inclusion could be about $4.5 billion, but total flows would be more.
""That's a widely anticipated event. Everybody's looking at that. It's a major thing for Saudi Arabia. It's one of the internationally accepted benchmarks and it gives MBS [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] additional credit for reform and change in the capital markets,"" said Sfakianakis.",2018-03-28T20:35:00.000+03:00
146,Cramer: The Amazon Prime rate bump is a clarion call to buy the stock,"When a company like Amazon raises the prices for its service and nobody cares, CNBC's Jim Cramer sees a clear next move.
""When you see something like that, it's about as clear a buy signal as you are ever, ever, ever going to get,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said on Friday after Amazon upped the price of its monthly Prime membership rate by 18 percent.
The price boost — from $10.99 to $12.99 for full-paying members — will total $156 a year, a ""smart"" move considering Amazon's yearly membership rate of $99 will remain the same, Cramer said.
""It's basically a tax on people who only pay month-to-month,"" he said.
Better yet, Cramer expected no resistance ""whatsoever"" to the price increase thanks to the quality and value that Amazon's Prime service provides.
""I bet most people don't even notice the price hike,"" he said. ""That's why Amazon remains a go-to name for anyone who needs a high-growth stock to round out their portfolio.""
The same goes for Netflix , Cramer argued. Nobody cared or resisted when the streaming giant raised the price of its 4K plan , which offers higher quality content, to $13.99 a month.
""Given that I pay $24 for two seats in a movie theater — $24 for a couple of maybe lousy hours of entertainment, pre-popcorn-and-candy, by the way — I'm thrilled to shell out a little more than just half that to binge on quality homegrown programming ... for a whole month,"" Cramer said.
Customers of Costco , which boasts some of the biggest bargains on the market, also tend to overlook when the big-box retailer raises the price of its membership cards, Cramer noted.
Apple's cloud service revenues also fall into this category. If privately-held music app Spotify ever comes public, its subscription-based service likely will, too, he said.
""The next time you get hit with a price increase and it doesn't bother you one bit, you need to pay up for the stock of that company in question, maybe even the next day,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""In every instance I just mentioned ... it's been worth it.""

HSBC's fortune turned around in 2017 with an increase in the year's profit. 
The bank, largest in Europe by assets, said Tuesday its full-year profit before tax rose 10.9 percent to $20.99 billion after adjusting for foreign currency translation and one-off items. That's beating an estimated $19.67 billion by Reuters and reversing the decline seen one year ago in 2016. 
The bank's reported profit before tax, meanwhile, rose 141.4 percent to $17.17 billion in the year 2017. 
Adjusted revenue for 2017 was $51.5 billion, up 5 percent from the previous year. 
""The figures are better than our forecasts,"" Kenny Wen, wealth management strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai, told CNBC. ""Our focus will be on the dividend policy as well as the share buybacks."" 
HSBC did not announce another round of share purchases as analysts had expected, but said in its earnings release that it would buy back shares ""as and when appropriate."" The bank has bought back $5.5 billion worth of shares from investors since August 2016.

Analysts had expected higher interest rates to boost HSBC's lending profitability, resulting in the improved financial performance. 
""I think they will have another, not a record, but better-than-expected earnings,"" Dickie Wong, executive director of Kingston Securities, told CNBC ahead of the release of the financial report. 
Wong added that HSBC is ""in a better shape"" compared to other international banks. 
Stuart Gulliver, instrumental in turning around HSBC, will step down as the bank's chief executive after Tuesday. He will be replaced by HSBC veteran John Flint , who most recently served as the bank's head of retail banking and wealth management. 
HSBC's latest earnings statement cemented its ability to pick itself up after the global financial crisis. In addition to shifting its focus to Asia, the bank also scaled back some of its operations, including selling its Brazilian business. 
""These results and the achievements of the last couple of years give us a great platform to build on,"" said Flint in a release that accompanied the earnings announcement.",2018-02-20T05:21:00.000+02:00
1369,How luxury fashion brands are increasingly using Instagram to win over millennials,"Luxury fashion brands such as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton are using social media to appeal to millennial customers to great effect, according to a report.
The industry's larger companies are using clever e-commerce and digital strategies to attract younger customers, UBS said in its European Luxury report, published Tuesday.
This, it added, is contributing to polarization where the big names have gained market share over smaller brands during the past five to 10 years.
""Our view is that the brands winning over new consumers (notably millennials) are those gaining share,"" the report stated.
The Kering -owned Gucci is so successful at attracting younger customers that 50 percent of its sales are to millennials, while the figure for Saint Laurent (also a Kering brand) is even larger at 65 percent.

Instagram looks to be key to this, with the two fashion labels having some of the highest followings of any luxury brands, correlating with higher sales to younger consumers.
Gucci has 20.3 million followers on the picture-sharing network — its latest posts feature the high-profile actors it dressed in black for the Golden Globes on Monday night — which has helped it attract millennial buyers. The appointment of Alessandro Michele as creative director in 2015 (described by Vogue as a ""relative unknown"" and ""daring"") has also appealed to the younger group, UBS suggested.
Peter White | Getty Images Model Mica Arganaraz walks the runway during the Louis Vuitton show at Paris Fashion Week on October 3, 2017 Louis Vuitton, meanwhile, has 20.7 million followers on Instagram, and 33 percent of its customers are millennials, according to UBS estimates.
Gucci was the largest share gainer of luxury fashion brands over five years (privately-owned Chanel is not included), with 11.8 percent of the market in 2013 increasing to 14.5 percent in 2017, according to UBS estimates. It gained share from Prada, for example, which had a 10.9 percent share of the luxury market in 2013, but this decreased to 7.1 percent in 2017.

Google searches for Gucci and Louis Vuitton are ahead of Chanel, Prada and Burberry; searches for luxury fashion brands peak each December, UBS's report said.
Kering had an 80 percent increase in its share price in 2017 and UBS expects organic sales at the luxury group to increase 8 percent in 2018, while it estimates that sales at smaller brand Prada will grow 3 percent, while at Burberry they will be flat.
The luxury fashion market in general is ""back in vogue,"" according to UBS, and it forecasts a 7 percent growth in the sector in 2018, driven in part by middle-class Chinese consumers.",2018-01-09T16:56:00.000+02:00

6051,Warren Buffett's winning investing strategy can be applied to any purchase,"When deciding whether or not to invest in a company, billionaire Warren Buffett looks for businesses that will continue to have a competitive advantage decades down the line . This "" buy and hold "" strategy is why Buffett says long-term investors in Apple shouldn't obsess over iPhone X sales.
""Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year,"" he said on CNBC's "" Squawk Box ."" ""They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years.""
Simply put, Buffett decides a business is worth investing in because it will last, not because it's doing well right now. He purchased See's Candies with longtime business partner Charlie Munger in 1972 and spent more than $1 billion on Coca-Cola stock in 1988 — both of which turned out to be good bets and both of which he still owns today.
""Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio's market value,"" Buffett wrote in his 1996 letter to shareholders. ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.""
show chapters Warren Buffett bought his first stock at 11 9:47 AM ET Thu, 13 July 2017 | 01:00 While not everyone will garner the same results as Buffett on the stock market, his core principle can be applied to almost every purchase we make: Invest for the long-term.
When deciding whether or not to buy a home, one of the first questions to ask yourself is: How long do I plan on staying here? The longer you live there, usually, the more valuable an investment real estate becomes.
""As a renter, you can easily spend half a million dollars or more on rent over the years ($1,500 a month for 30 years comes to $540,000), and in the end wind up just where you started — owning nothing,"" self-made millionaire David Bach writes in "" The Automatic Millionaire ."" ""Or you can buy a house and spend the same amount paying down a mortgage, and in the end wind up owning your own home free and clear!""
The same goes for clothing, appliances, furniture and anything else that you use on a daily basis . While it's tempting to skimp and get the cheapest option, especially if you're on a tight budget, over time, nicer items may hold up better, making the initial outlay worth it.
show chapters How to eat on just $3 a day 6:29 PM ET Wed, 18 Jan 2017 | 02:40 Think of it in terms of cost per use. For example, say you invest in a $200 blazer from a high-end store. If it's a wardrobe staple and you wear it twice a week for the whole year, that's 104 days of wear. Divide the cost, $200, by the number of days, and you end up with less than $2 per wear. Not a bad deal, especially if you feel great in it.
Whether you're shopping for a new pair of jeans or in the market for a new car, apply the Buffett rule to your next purchase: Is this something worth holding onto?
If the Oracle of Omaha serves as any example, the discipline to buy things only when you really, really like them pays off.

The most important lesson to be learned from the three-day market correction – that sent the Dow Jones industrial average down some 2,100 points at one point on Tuesday and nearly nine percent from its recent highs – is to understand that it is healthy, normal and welcome. 
It is also long overdue. What has not been healthy, or normal, has been the sentiment that has emerged in the past 15 months that Donald Trump is some sort of magician presiding over a stock market that only seems to go in one direction: straight up. 
So-called market experts are positing lots of reasons for why the stock market started to crack last Friday. Among them: the end of cheap money, as interest rates around the world begin to rise; a pick-up in inflation as unemployment continues to fall and wages begin to increase in order for businesses to continue to attract the employees they need; the fact that expected tax benefits have already been baked into the market's rise; a fear that there were asset bubbles everywhere you look, whether it be bitcoin, high-end Manhattan real-estate or fine art; and the thought that all the traders who bet that volatility would continue to be benign were getting their heads handed to them and have been forced to take their losses. 
There are plenty of logical reasons to go around to explain the last three days of trading but the most compelling, for me anyway, is Occam's Razor: It simply became time for the pressure building up in the stock markets to be released. 
Since March 2009, two months after Obama took office in the wake of the worst financial crisis in generations, the Dow quadrupled to its peak of around 26,600 from its near-term trough of around 6,500. Nine years of a bull market is a long time by any historical measure. In the first year following Trump's election, the Dow rose 28.5 percent. And it kept on increasing another 13 percent or so in the past few months, until it reached its all-time high on January 26. 
So, yes, for the last 10 days or so, the market has been in a corrective mode. It is down some 8.5 percent since its late January peak. But it's important to keep the decline in perspective – and to not panic. 
We are light years away, in prescriptive terms, from the one-day collapse of 22.6 percent, which occurred on Black Monday 1987. That was a genuine panic, as I saw myself, with grown men huddled around their Quotron machines – desktop real-time quotes were still years away – with tears streaming down their faces as they contemplated the extreme loss of wealth they were experiencing. Maria Bastone | AFP | Getty Images A trader (c) on the New York Stock Exchange looks at stock rates 19 October 1987 as stocks were devastated during one of the most frantic days in the exchange's history. 
But even that one-day financial disaster turned out to be a blip in retrospect. The better choice that day – as it will probably be this time around, too – is to stay invested in the stock markets – to not panic and sell. But rather to recognize that, as they say on Wall Street, ""trees don't grow to the sky"" and that releasing a little steam from an overheated market is often just what's needed. 
When it comes to investing, who better to paraphrase than the guru Warren Buffett: In the end, either you have faith in American ingenuity, know-how and capitalism, or you don't. If you do, then these kinds of corrections inevitably result in a buying opportunity. That's why Buffett was the first one to step in and proclaim the financial crisis of 2008 a most excellent time to invest. (And he was right). And if you don't buy into the American Dream, or what's left of it, well then, I hear that Denmark is a very nice place to live.

2511,"California agriculture sees 'chilling, damaging effect' from wave of immigration audits","Getty Images A file photo of Mexican agricultural workers on a farm in Holtville, Calif. 
California's agriculture industry already faces a farm labor shortage but now it's facing added pressure due to a wave of employee audits ordered for large farms throughout the state's Central Valley. 
Up to 10 agribusiness employers in the state's San Joaquin Valley were recently contacted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about notices of inspection, said Manuel Cunha, president of the Nisei Farmers League, a Fresno-based agriculture advocacy group. 
""These ICE audits have had nothing but a chilling, damaging effect,"" Cunha said Thursday. 
Some have suggested that California businesses are being unfairly targeted in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts due to the state's controversial ""sanctuary law,"" whic h limits local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities. 
However, President Donald Trump said Thursday he's considering pulling federal immigration enforcement agents from California. He made those comments after lashing out at California's ""sanctuary"" state status and ""protection of these horrible criminals."" 
""We're getting no help from the state of California,"" Trump said. ""Frankly, if I wanted to pull our people from California, you would have a crime mess like you've never seen. All I'd have to do is say, 'ICE and Border Patrol, let California alone,' You'd be inundated, you would see crime like nobody's ever seen crime in this country."" 
The latest ICE audits on agribusinesses involved packing and processing houses as well as some farms were asked to show their hiring records. 
""There were a couple of agricultural facilities that did have the audits that were taking place in the last couple of weeks,"" said Ryan Jacobsen, CEO of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. ""It's been a couple of years since we saw it to the extent that we did."" 
Jacobsen said last year was ""an extraordinarily tight year"" in terms of farm labor supply in the Central Valley and arguably the tightest the region has seen in a decade. ""The assumption is that this will continue into this year, but we're on the early cusp on when a lot of the [agricultural] activity really gets going in the valley."" 
The federal immigration audits in the state's top ag region follows last week's announcement that ICE agents conducted a week-long crackdown in Southern California, arresting 212 undocumented immigrants and serving notices of inspection to 122 businesses . Also, in January dozens of other businesses in Northern California were audited. 
ICE declined comment for this story. 
Federal officials have previously said the focus of the employee audits nationwide is on a wide variety of industries and of various sizes, from small to large, because ""all businesses regardless of industry or size, are expected to comply with the law."" 
Meantime, the state also passed an Immigrant Worker Protection Act that went into effect in January that bars employers from voluntarily giving employee information to federal authorities. It also requires employers to notify all employees of inspections of their employment records by U.S. immigration agencies within 72 hours of receiving notice of the federal audit. 
California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has warned in January that businesses could face a fine of $10,000 if they violated the new law. According to Cunha, the state attorney general's threat to go after companies has made the situation tougher for employers and the requirement of posting the letter of a pending audit has scared farm workers.",2018-02-22T23:42:00.000+02:00
3397,Trump stuns lawmakers and says some are too fearful of the NRA to take action on gun control,"Putting fellow Republicans in the hot seat, President Donald Trump called for speedy and substantial changes to the nation's gun laws, then criticized lawmakers in a White House meeting for being too fearful of the National Rifle Association to take action.
In a freewheeling, televised session that stretched for an hour Wednesday, Trump rejected both his party's incremental approach and its legislative strategy that has stalled action in Congress. Giving hope to Democrats, he said he favored a ""comprehensive"" approach to addressing violence like the shooting at a Florida high school earlier this month, although he offered no specific details.
Instead, Trump again voiced his support for expanded background checks. He endorsed increased school security and mental health resources, and he reaffirmed his support for raising the age to 21 for purchasing some firearms. Trump also mentioned arming teachers and said his administration, not Congress, would ban bump-stock devices that enable guns to fire like automatic weapons with an executive order.
""We can't wait and play games and nothing gets done,"" Trump said as he opened the session with 17 House and Senate lawmakers. ""We want to stop the problems.""
show chapters Walmart raises minimum age to buy guns      9 Hours Ago | 00:44 Trump also raised eyebrows by suggesting that law enforcement officials should be able to confiscate people's firearms without a court order to prevent potential tragedies.
""Take the guns first, go through due process second,"" he suggested.
The president has previously backed ideas popular with Democrats, only to back away when faced with opposition from his conservative base and his GOP allies in Congress. It was not clear whether he would continue to push for swift and significant changes to gun laws, when confronted with the inevitable resistance from his party.
Still, the televised discussion allowed Trump to play the role of potential dealmaker, a favorite for the president. Democratic lawmakers made a point of appealing to the president to use his political power to persuade his party to take action.
""It is going to have to be you,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Trump.
Trump's call for stronger background checks, which are popular among Americans, has been resisted by Republicans in Congress and the NRA. Republicans have instead been leaning toward modest legislation designed to improve the background system already in place. Trump made clear he was looking for more and accused lawmakers of being ""petrified"" of the gun lobby.
""Hey, I'm the biggest fan of the Second Amendment,"" Trump said, adding that he told NRA officials it's time to act. ""We have to stop this nonsense.""
The White House meeting came amid fresh public debate over gun laws, fueled by student survivors of the massacre at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, who have been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The school reopened Wednesday for the first time since a Valentine's Day assault killed 17.
Gun legislation has lost momentum in Congress as Republican leaders showed little interest in pursuing stricter gun control laws.
Democrats said they were concerned Trump's interest may fade quickly. After the meeting, Murphy told reporters: ""I'm worried that this was the beginning and the end of the president's advocacy on this issue. The White House has to put some meat on the bones. The White House has to send a proposal to Congress.""
The White House is expected to reveal more on the president's plans for school safety later this week. That announcement will likely include goals for background checks and bump stocks, though whether age restrictions will be specifically addressed remains unclear, according to an administration official who sought anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Trump rejected the way Republican leaders in Congress have framed the debate, saying the House-backed bill linking a background check measure with a bill to expand gun rights by allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines was not the right approach. The concealed carry measure is the gun lobby's top legislative priority. But ""you'll never get it passed,"" Trump told lawmakers, reminding them that Democratic senators, including some in the room, strongly oppose it.
Instead, he suggested Republicans should focus on the background check bill, then load it up with other gun control and safety measures.
Ever the marketer, Trump suggested that the leading bill adjusting the National Instant Criminal Background Check System — now known as ""Fix NICS"" — could use a new name. ""Maybe you change the title, all right? The U.S. Background Check Bill, or whatever,"" Trump said.
The hour-long meeting with lawmakers was reminiscent of one in January on immigration, when he told lawmakers to come up with a good bill and he would take the ""heat"" from critics.
That effort, however, ended in failure in Congress amid Trump's shifting views and priorities in the debate.
Among those at the White House Wednesday were Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin , D-W.Va., who are pushing their bill — it failed twice in the Senate after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting — to broaden background checks to include pre-purchase reviews at online and gun show sales.
Trump asked Toomey if his plan to expand background checks included raising the minimum age for young people to buy an assault weapon. Toomey told the president it did not.
""You know why,"" Trump scoffed. ""Because you're afraid of the NRA.""
In fact, Toomey is one of the most high-profile Republicans on gun legislation, and the bill was opposed by the NRA. After earlier votes on the bill, the group downgraded its rating of the senator as he ran for re-election.
The meeting came after one major retailer, Dick's Sporting Goods , announced it was halting sales of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines at all of its stores and banning the sale of all guns to anyone under 21. Walmart , the nation's largest retailer, followed late Wednesday, saying it would no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 .
The discussion was billed as a session focused on ""school and community safety,"" and two of those attending, Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah, and Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., have proposed new federal grant funding to stem school violence. The bill would offer money for law enforcement and school staff training, campus infrastructure upgrades and mental health resources.

-sources@ (Repeats story from Wednesday with no changes to text) 
SAO PAULO, March 7 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc met in Brazil last week with an array of manufacturers to discuss plans to stock and sell products from consumer electronics to perfume in the country, according to two people that took part in the meetings. 
The move would take the U.S. e-commerce giant beyond its current role in Brazil as a marketplace for third-party sellers, representing a major advance into the biggest retail market in Latin America. 
Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment on the talks, adding that the company had held ""hundreds of meetings with potential vendors and suppliers about its business in Brazil and possible future plans"" in the past five years. 
Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil's complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October. 
Yet the company appears to be accelerating its expansion this year as the Brazilian economy exits a painful recession, stiffening competition for local rivals such as Mercado Libre Inc, B2w Cia Digital, Via Varejo SA and Magazine Luiza SA. 
Last month, Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a large warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo. 
E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil's roughly $300 billion retail market about half its share in the United States but has doubled in the past four years and is forecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace. 
Amazon representatives, including senior executive Ticiana Mártyres, told several dozen potential suppliers gathered at the Hotel Blue Tree Morumbi last week that the company planned to use its own transportation and call centers in Brazil, according to one of the sources. 
""They said they were going to buy directly from the manufacturers and resell,"" said the person, who requested anonymity due to the confidential terms of the talks. 
Amazon said it would store goods at its facilities in Greater Sao Paulo, the source added.

608,Intel set to report earnings after the bell,"Intel stock rose more than 4.5 percent after the company released better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 on Thursday. The company will hold a conference call with analysts at 5 p.m. Eastern time.
EPS: Excluding certain items, $1.08 in earnings per share vs. $0.86 in earnings per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $17.05 billion vs. $16.35 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. The company's total revenue for the quarter was up 4 percent year over year. And for the full year revenue came in at $62.8 billion, which was up 6 percent.
Intel's biggest segment, the Client Computing Group, brought in $9 billion, down 2 percent year over year, in the fourth quarter. But the second largest segment, the Data Center Group, grew 20 percent, with $5.6 billion in revenue. Both groups beat FactSet consensus estimates, which were $8.73 billion from the former and $5.09 billion from the latter, according to StreetAccount.
The company has faced pressure around its handling of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities , which were disclosed on Jan. 3.
The issues affect chips made by several companies, although the Meltdown issue has had an especially large impact on Intel's processors. On Wednesday, a House committee said it had sent letters to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and other tech leaders to learn about why Intel and other companies had withheld information about the issues for months before publicly announcing them.
Indeed, Intel acknowledged controversies related to the security issues in the forward-looking statements sections of the earnings report :
We have and may continue to face product claims, litigation, and adverse publicity and customer relations from security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques, including as a result of side-channel exploits such as ""Spectre"" and ""Meltdown,"" which could adversely impact our results of operations, customer relationships,and reputation. Separately, the publicity around recently disclosed security vulnerabilities may result inincreased attempts by third parties to identify additional vulnerabilities, and future vulnerabilities and mitigation of those vulnerabilities may also adversely impact our results of operations, customer relationships, and reputation.
Intel had a one-time charge of $5.4 billion because of U.S. tax reform. Intel is expecting a 14 percent tax rate through 2018, and the company announced a 10 percent increase to its quarterly cash dividend that's tied to the tax changes.
In terms of guidance, for the first quarter of 2018 Intel said it's expecting $0.70 per share, give or take 5 cents, excluding certain items, on $15 billion in revenue, give or take $500 million. Analysts were expecting $0.72 per share, excluding certain items, on $15.03 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.
And for all of 2018, Intel said it's expecting $3.55 in earnings per share, plus or minus 5 percent, on $65 billion in revenue, plus or minus $1 billion. Analysts had been expecting $3.27 in earnings per share on $63.80 billion in revenue for the full year, according to Thomson Reuters.
In the fourth quarter, Intel announced that it had hired the head of AMD's graphics business , Raja Koduri, and that it would begin making discrete graphics cards — an area where Nvidia is the market leader. Also, Krzanich sent employees a memo in which he said the company would take more risks.
Intel stock is down about 2 percent since the beginning of the year.

6287,"GRAINS-Wheat, corn hit multimonth highs; soy stages late rally","GRAINS-Wheat, corn hit multimonth highs; soy stages late rally Julie Ingwersen Published 22 Hours Ago Reuters
(New throughout; updates prices, adds quotes; changes byline, dateline, previous PARIS/SINGAPORE) CHICAGO, May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures climbed to multimonth highs Thursday on a mix of short-covering and worries about the size of the hard red winter wheat crop in top producer Kansas, traders said. Soybeans rose, staging a late-session rally that some traders attributed to optimism about the outcome of U.S. trade talks with top global soy buyer China. Corn also advanced. At the Chicago Board of Trade, July soft red winter wheat futures ended up 11-1/4 cents at $5.38 a bushel. CBOT July soybeans settled up 10-1/4 cents at $10.53-1/4 a bushel and July corn was up 3 cents at $4.08 a bushel. Technical buying in CBOT wheat accelerated as the July contract surpassed Wednesday's top and reached $5.38-1/2 a bushel, its highest since Aug. 1. The market got a lift late in the session as scouts on a Wheat Quality Council crop tour projected the winter wheat yield in Kansas, the top U.S. wheat state, at 37.0 bushels per acre. The scouts pegged Kansas wheat production at 243.3 million bushels, potentially the smallest crop since 1989, reflecting the impact of drought. ""The tour called Kansas production 243 million bushels, which puts them a good 30 million bushels less than the trade,"" ED&F Man Capital analyst Charlie Sernatinger said in a client note. K.C. July hard red winter wheat ended up 12-1/2 cents at $5.67-3/4, its fifth straight higher close, after reaching $5.68-1/2, its highest since July 21. Soybeans advanced after a back-and forth session, turning up in the final 15 minutes of the session on a mix of technical buying and optimism about the outcome of U.S. trade talks with top global soy buyer China. ""The U.S. trade team started negotiations in China, and make no mistake about it, this is the driving fundamental for the moment on beans,"" Sernatinger wrote. CBOT July soyoil rose for a second straight session, buoyed by stronger-than-expected weekly U.S. export sales and confirmation that private exporters sold 30,000 tonnes of U.S. soyoil to Peru. July corn hit its highest since Aug. 10 as traders continued to fixate on dry weather that is stressing second-crop corn in Brazil. ""Rains are expected to remain very limited across the region this week, with just a few showers expected in northwestern Mato Grosso. This will allow soil moisture shortages to continue to expand northward,"" Radiant Solutions said in a daily crop weather note. Meanwhile, rain in Argentina has slowed the harvest of corn and soy crops that were slashed by drought earlier in the season.

6895,AK Steel gives up Trump gains despite tariffs and Goldman believes the stock will fall further,"CNBC.com Getty Images Roger Newport, chief executive officer of AK Steel Holding Corp., listens during a press conference following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and steel and aluminum executives at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 1, 2018.
Profitability at parts of AK Steel remains limited, according to Goldman Sachs, despite support from President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on foreign steel.
The bank downgraded shares to sell from neutral on Wednesday citing increased competition within its core automotive U.S. business .
""AK Steel shares are now trading below their level from early November 2016, having given back the gains made with the election of President Trump in November 2016, the initial run-up of the current cycle in domestic steel prices starting in November 2017, and the Department of Commerce announcement in February 2018 of more stringent-than-expected recommended Section 232 remedies,"" Goldman analyst Matthew Korn wrote Tuesday.
""Now, with our updated estimates reflecting lower forecasts for realized pricing and profitability, the risk/reward for AK Steel looks unfavorable,"" he added.
Shares of AK Steel fell more than 2 percent in premarket trading following the Goldman Sachs note.
Shares of the nation's major steel producers have gyrated in recent months, rising and falling on the nuances of the Trump administration's pursuit of tariffs on imports of steel. The White House's decision to push back the tariff deadline in early May, for example, sent shares of rivals U.S. Steel and Nucor down 6 percent and 2 percent respectively.
Hoping to address creeping doubts over the future of the taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports – a key target of the original policy – will stay in place even as the administration suspends separate tariffs on Chinese goods.
""As it relates to China, the steel and aluminum tariffs will remain enforced,"" he said. ""Those were not part of our discussions. We were merely focused on the proposed $150 billion.""
""Those are not being touched,"" he added.
Notwithstanding the assurance from Mnuchin, AK Steel's stock price, which rallied more than 60 percent in the months immediately following President Trump's election, has tumbled back to their pre-election levels above $4.
With weaker-than-expected quarterly guidance on pricing and profits, Goldman Sachs believes the stocks could sink further.
Analyst Korn cut his 12-month price forecast for the company to $4 from $6, implying 9.5 percent downside from Tuesday's close.",2018-05-30T15:38:00.000+03:00
3582,Toys R Us closures will leave hundreds of vacant stores on the market with few obvious replacements,"Toys R Us is planning to close or sell more than 800 stores across the U.S., leaving a surplus of unoccupied real estate on the market.
The abrupt shuttering of the toy chain spells good news and bad news for landlords. Some are betting on being able to find more profitable uses, while others will be left scrambling to find replacements.
""An important distinction between Toys and other recent bankruptcies is that many of Toys' leases [today] are well-below market — a silver lining for landlords,"" analysts from Green Street Advisors wrote in a note to clients.
In the case of Toys R Us, they added, there's an opportunity for real estate owners to secure new tenants paying higher rents per square foot, and that would mean a much better outcome.
show chapters Here’s where all the closing Toys R Us stores are 1:12 PM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 00:41 Still, many of the Toys R Us and Babies R Us locations on the chopping block are more than 40,000 square feet, some are more than 65,000, and this is ""problematic as the list of retailers seeking that [floor plan] is short,"" Green Street wrote. ""More bankruptcies is putting further pressure on big box market rents.""
The retail real estate industry has had its share of departures by key tenants in the past, including Circuit City, Sports Authority and RadioShack. Toys R Us' moves are viewed as further dragging down the reputation of U.S. strip centers anchored by bigger boxes.
Retailers that tend to occupy more space along shopping centers today include Dick's Sporting Goods , Big Lots , Party City and Best Buy — and these retailers aren't adding as many stores as they once were. Even Target and Kohl's are focused more on opening smaller-format stores. And investments are moving online.
More recently, though, some companies have said they will be willing to open more stores once rents stabilize.
""We have slowed down our store growth ... [because] we think that the real estate prices are going to continue to fall,"" Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack said on a call with analysts and investors earlier this week.
""We're going to wait, and let's see what happens with the real estate prices with additional store closings,"" Stack said just two days before Toys R Us made its liquidation plans official.
Starbucks co-founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz made a similar comment late last month when asked about the coffee giant's U.S. expansion plans.
Schultz said he's seen an ""abundance of empty storefronts across the country,"" predicting that rents would fall further. ""This is not going to be a cyclical change in our occupancy expenses, but a permanent lowering of the cost of our real estate.""
Toys R Us' departure could spur some of these businesses to grow again, if the price is right.
Landlords left scrambling Only a small percentage of buildings occupied by Toys R Us are owned by U.S. real estate investment trusts. But REIT stocks have taken a beating on the fallout, with investors looking for ways to trade on the news.
Carlos Osorio | Toronto Star | Getty Images An empty parking lot outside a Toys R Us store. Many of Toys R Us' U.S. locations are leased back to a separate entity created by the company known as Toys R Us Property Co., or Propco. REITs including Simon (13 small-format locations at its outlets), Kimco (24 stores), Brixmor (12 stores), Weingarten (four stores) and DDR (20 stores) own a handful of shops, while the remainder is owned directly by the toy retailer, securities filings show.
Urban Edge Properties , a spinoff from Vornado , which played a role in acquiring Toys R Us in 2015, has a larger percentage of exposure to the retailer with nine locations in its portfolio of only 90 centers.
Some REITs have already told CNBC they plan to redevelop existing Toys R Us locations to fit a handful of smaller companies once the liquidation process is complete.
Not many landlords foresaw the liquidation, announced Thursday. They were expecting some possible closures in a restructuring after Toys R Us emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last September, but not to this magnitude.
Analysts have drawn parallels to when big-box retailer Sports Authority initially hoped to reorganize its business but ultimately was forced in 2016 to shutter its roughly 460 stores after a failed attempt to find a bidder. Some of those locations are still looking for replacements, people familiar with the real estate market told CNBC.
""There was ample demand for the [Sports Authority] space, but the turnaround time from losing a large box tenant and the new tenant(s) occupying space is 1.5 – 2.0 years,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Wes Golladay said.
In the case of Toys R Us, he added, ""ideally, the landlords will look to re-tenant with retailers such as off-price retailers, which would require less reconfiguration."" Companies like TJ Maxx and Homegoods owner TJX and Ross Stores are still actively adding more locations.
A spokesman from Kimco told CNBC: ""During the liquidation process, some leases may be acquired by other tenants, which would limit downtime and lost rent, while the bigger opportunity ... is the ability to recapture some of these older boxes, which may spark potential future redevelopments and help unlock the embedded value of the real estate in our core U.S. markets.""
A similar situation has been playing out as Sears Holdings closes stores (both Sears within malls and Kmart at shopping centers). Many landlords have welcomed the opportunity to recapture those spaces for other uses, landing tenants that can pay more per square foot.
Toys R Us is still shopping a deal that would save as many as 200 of its U.S. stores from going dark. It hasn't disclosed which locations could be saved. The company also hasn't yet provided a timeline on other liquidation sales.

1930,'He must be stopped': Trump lashes out at top Dem on House intel panel,"President Donald Trump lashed out at the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee Monday, a day after Democrats and Republicans said Trump was wrong to assert that a GOP-produced classified memo on FBI surveillance powers cleared him in the Russia investigation.
The House intelligence panel plans to meet Monday afternoon and is expected to consider whether to release a Democratic rebuttal memo. The committee rejected that move last week, with one Republican member saying revisions were needed so the memo would not endanger national security.
Trump would decide whether to release the memo if it contains classified information.
A White House official said Monday that the administration would consider releasing the Democratic memo, subjecting it to a similar review process as the Republican memo. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and sought anonymity to discuss internal thinking.
The Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has urged Trump to back the public release and said that refusing to do so would show the president's intent to undermine the Russia investigation.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia as well as whether there have been efforts to obstruct the investigation.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he supports the release of the Democrats' memo, if sensitive intelligence information is removed.
Trump strode into the debate Monday on Twitter, saying: ""Little Adam Schiff , who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey , Warner , Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!""
Schiff has branded the GOP memo ""a political hit job"" and has questioned whether the chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., had coordinated with the White House in drafting the document seized on by the president to vent his grievances against the nation's premier law enforcement agencies.
""The goal here is to undermine the FBI, discredit the FBI, discredit the Mueller investigation, do the president's bidding,"" Schiff said. ""I think it's very possible his staff worked with the White House.""
Nunes was asked during a Jan. 29 committee meeting whether he had coordinated the memo with the White House. ""As far as I know, no,"" he responded, then refused to answer when asked whether his staff members had communicated with the White House. He had previously apologized for sharing with the White House secret intelligence intercepts related to an investigation of Russian election interference before talking to committee members.
Trump's Saturday tweet that the memo ""totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe"" even as ""the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on"" found no echo from four committee Republicans who appeared on the Sunday talk shows.
Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, said, ""I think this is a separate issue."" Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said, ""No, it doesn't end that."" Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said, ""I don't,"" when asked whether he agreed with Trump. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., asked whether the memo affected the investigation, said, ""No, not to me, it doesn't, and I was pretty integrally involved in the drafting of it.""
The Democratic response was more expected: ""Of course, not at all,"" said Schiff. Added Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill.: ""No, of course it does not.""
Lawmakers also said the memo should not impede Mueller.
""I think it would be a mistake for anyone to suggest that the special counsel shouldn't complete his work. I support his work. I want him to finish it. I hope he finishes it as quickly as possible,"" Stewart said.
The memo released Friday alleges misconduct on the part of the FBI and the Justice Department in obtaining a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to monitor former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his ties to Russia. Specifically, it takes aim at the FBI's use of information from former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier containing allegations of ties between Trump, his associates and Russia.
The underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the GOP memo. Even as Democrats described it as inaccurate, some Republicans quickly cited the memo — released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department — in their arguments that Mueller's investigation is politically tainted.
The memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion received funding from Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.
Steele's research, according to the memo, ""formed an essential part"" of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated.
Republicans say a judge should have known that ""political actors"" were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently denied.
The memo confirms the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was ""triggered"" by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI.
The confirmation about Papadopoulos is ""the most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo,"" Schiff said Saturday.

Self-made billionaire Richard Branson says his ability to cross the Pacific Ocean in a hot air balloon and pursue his dream of traveling to space by starting a commercial spaceflight company comes from being a forward-thinking leader. 
""I've never really had the desire to fit in and that's served me well in business. Innovation doesn't come from being comfortable and doing what everyone else is doing,"" Branson wrote in a recent blog post . 
In order to become comfortable in your creativity and different way of thinking, Branson shared this main lesson: ""Don't waste your time trying to be normal."" show chapters 2:04 PM ET Wed, 30 Aug 2017 | 02:16 
""We all have different qualities and strengths and we should use these to our advantage rather than just try to be like everybody else,"" he explained. 
Branson noted that whether it was leaving school at 16 or starting his airline with no experience of the aviation industry, he's always done things differently than others. 
As a child, Branson had the opportunity to pursue his ""outlandish ideas"" thanks to his family. 
""My parents nurtured my entrepreneurial spirit — even allowing me to grow Christmas trees and breed budgerigars to try and turn a profit when I was young,"" Branson wrote. ""They always had a positive attitude to my crazy ideas and I'm so glad they didn't try and force me to conform."" 
In 1997, Steve Jobs included Branson in an Apple marketing campaign titled ""Think Different."" Branson was featured in a montage of clips including Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lennon, as Jobs' voiceover said, ""Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently."" show chapters 12:14 PM ET Thu, 24 Aug 2017 | 01:33 
For Branson, the ability to be disruptive is ""an attitude that's shared by all leaders who seek to make a real difference."" 
""The mark of a good leader,"" Branson added, ""is being able to harness these different talents and empower people to be the best that they can be."" 
The Virgin Group founder got onto his unique path to success by doing what suited him best and playing to his strengths. As a result, he recommends that others also define their own paths to success. 
But Branson says the risk of choosing the path less traveled will only pay off by doing these two things: ""If you pick yourself up time and time again and if you've done your homework."" ",2018-01-09T18:49:00.000+02:00
2931,"From 'Nirvana' to a 'Led Zeppelin' market, PNC Financial predicts no stairway to heaven for gains","If last year felt like ""investing nirvana,"" PNC Financial says this investing climate is feeling more like ""Led Zeppelin.""
The firm's co-chief investment strategist, Amanda Agati, believes the path to gains will be no stairway to heaven.
""It feels like the market is a little bit heavier this year,"" she said Monday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation .""
It appears that heaviness was bearing down on Wall Street as trading kicked off the week.
The Dow saw its worst day since March 1 and closed below its 100-day moving average. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also ran into trouble — seeing their worst days in nearly six weeks.
Agati blames several headwinds that were virtually nonexistent last year for the issues facing Wall Street. They include 10-Year Treasury rates and volatility ticking up — as well as policy issues surrounding leadership and tariffs in Washington.
""Typically, the markets shrug off kind of the first year of a new administration. It's sort of a courting period or a getting-to-know-you kind of phase between D.C. and the markets,"" said Agati. ""That time is about up now. We're starting to see that, I think, impact market sentiment.""
But that doesn't mean 2018 will be a train wreck.
""It's not that we don't think the markets can't eke out decent gains for the year. But we think it's a tougher slog ahead,"" she added.
Agati doesn't see signs of a bear market or another correction. She believes the next chance of a recession likely won't happen until early 2020.
But what has changed is the market cycle, according to Agati. She's advocating active over passive investing.
""When you have a rapidly rising market and cycle, which is what we've been in the last few years, it pays to have just broad-based market exposure,"" she said. ""With this sort of coming in towards the end of a cycle or at least being in the later innings, we do think there will be a resurgence of opportunities for active managers.""
Her favorite groups include regional banks and defense right now.
""We really like the regional banks here. Although they have had a nice run, we think there's still a lot of opportunity left. They're certainly a key beneficiary of rising rates, and the mortgage market has been pretty strong,"" Agati said.
As for defense, she believes the recent pullback is a solid entry point for investors and could result in a pitch perfect investment.

2327,Trump's economic advisers throw cold water on his proposal to raise gas tax,"3 Hours Ago | 02:32 
President Donald Trump 's Council of Economic Advisers warned on Wednesday that taxing gasoline to pay for infrastructure improvements is an ""imperfect"" system. 
The input from the president's top advisers on the economy comes after Trump proposed raising the federal gas tax by 25 cents to pay for his infrastructure plan. The idea has raised the hackles of some conservatives, who believe it could offset the benefit from recently passed GOP tax cuts and put Republicans in a tough spot ahead of midterm elections. 
In a report released Wednesday, the Council of Economic Advisers raised a number of concerns about relying on taxes to pay for the nation's roadways. ""One of the things that we point out in the economic report to the president that came out today is that the gas tax's current design isn't really a 21st century design — that the gas tax was set at levels that were needed to fund highways back in the days when fuel economy was really low and we didn't have electric cars,"" Kevin Hassett, the council's chairman, told CNBC on Wednesday. 
The 18.4-cents gasoline levy, which funds federal highway and mass transport spending, was last raised in 1993. Since then, inflation and rising fuel efficiency standards have eroded the purchasing power of funds raised through the tax. Getty Images A woman fills her vehicle with gas at a U-Gas station in Miami. 
The council's report says fuel taxes don't encourage efficient use of the nation's roads or reflect costs associated with congestion. The council notes that driving 100 miles on underused rural streets drums up the same tax revenue as driving the same distance on busy urban roads during rush hour. 
Further, electric vehicles and highly fuel-efficient cars do not generate enough revenue from a gas tax to offset their wear and tear on roads, according to the council. 
""Imagine if everybody drove a Tesla ,"" Hassett said. ""Then how is the gas tax going to be maintained to pay for the roads?"" 
Meanwhile, heavy trucks might not be paying enough in fuel taxes and fees to account for the disproportionate road damage, emissions and congestion they cause, the council says. 
In their view, the case for paying for infrastructure through tolls is ""solid,"" despite the higher administrative costs of collecting the fees. Tolls allow governments to collect funds from the people who use roads and bridges, and motorists and commercial truckers use them to the extent that the costs equal the benefits. 
The advisers also highlight options like charging heavy trucks per distance traveled and allowing low-occupancy cars to travel in high-occupancy lanes for a fee. The federal tax on diesel is 24.4 cents. 
Despite the issues the council raises with the gas tax, Hassett said that lawmakers should keep their options open. 
"" I think that the appropriate thing right now is to understand it's incredibly important to pass an infrastructure bill ... and that to do that you're going to need to fund it,"" he said. 
""Right now, the president says that we should put the options on the table and think about them.""",2018-02-21T23:34:00.000+02:00

766,"Neiman Marcus names Geoffroy van Raemdonck CEO, replacing Karen Katz","Neiman Marcus is appointing Ralph Lauren veteran Geoffroy van Raemdonck to succeed Karen Katz as its CEO, the retailer announced Friday.
Katz's retirement is effective Feb. 12, 2018. However, she will continue to serve on the company's board of directors, Neiman Marcus said.
The move comes at a crucial time for the high-end department store, which has been working to restructure its roughly $4.4 billion in long-term net debt and readjust to the rapidly changing retail landscape.
Katz's resignation follows that of John Koryl, president of Neiman Marcus stores and online, who stepped stepped down late last year.
Raemdonck previously worked as CEO of luxury fashion brand St. John Knits International and held several internationally focused positions at Ralph Lauren, including most recently president of south Europe.
Raemdonck is ""a global industry leader and business builder with exceptional vision and energy,"" Neiman Chairman David Kaplan said in a statement.
""Neiman Marcus is still one of the great American retail companies,"" said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Harrison Group and founder and chairman emeritus of investment bank Financo. ""With the new leadership working with existing management, there could be opportunity for the brand to extend its reach globally.""
Still, the retailer has challenges ahead.
It made its name in large part on high-end clothing and personal shopping, but the younger generation spends less on, and seemingly cares less about, clothes. The stronger U.S. dollar has also been negative for Neiman Marcus, curbing spending at its Bergdorf Goodman department stores, which are popular with New York tourists.
Department stores across the board have struggled as brands increasingly look to reach their shoppers without a middleman, and they deal with excess real estate no longer in sync with how consumers shop.",2018-01-05T17:12:00.000+02:00
4496,Facebook is changing terms to minimize the number of users covered by new EU privacy law,"If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people's online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion Facebook users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller.
Facebook members outside the United States and Canada , whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Ireland .
Next month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for only European users, meaning 1.5 billion members in Africa , Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25.
The previously unreported move, which Facebook confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday, shows the world's largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.
That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could mean billions of dollars.
The change comes as Facebook is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.
The change affects more than 70 percent of Facebook's 2 billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.
Facebook, like many other U.S. technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union. Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.
'In spirit' In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.
""We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,"" the company said.
Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally ""in spirit,"" but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.
In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient U.S. privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.
Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law
but are not as protected in the United States, he said.
The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, ""because EU law requires specific language."" For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.
No warning Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.
Facebook released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.
Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn.
LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. ""We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,"" the company said.",2018-04-19T03:44:00.000+03:00

3255,"Trump’s metal tariffs are ‘like an atomic bomb’ for European firms, lobbyist says","Donald Trump 's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum could cause major disruption for companies in Europe, a business lobbyist told CNBC Monday, who argued that the U.S. president should have taken less severe measures to protect his domestic market.
U.S.'s allies, including the European Union and Japan, are hoping to be excluded from new tariffs that Trump announced last week. The decision to raise steel import taxes by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent could hurt not only those industries directly, but also carmakers and construction firms which use the raw materials. Trump decided that the tariffs would be the best way to deal with overcapacity in these sectors and based his argument on national security.
""This is a very exceptional mechanism that is rarely used. It's a bit considered like an atomic bomb, because really to use this is like saying 'look we are really at a level where we cannot use anti-damping or anti-subsidies',"" Luisa Santos, the international relations director at BusinessEurope, told CNBC Monday.
show chapters Don't know how US steel tariffs will impact world trade: BusinessEurope 10 Hours Ago | 03:30 Anti-dumping measures are protectionist tariffs that a government imposes on imported goods that are more expensive in their domestic market. Anti-subsidies are duties imposed on imported products that receive some sort of financial aid from their own governments, interpreted as market disruptors.
""I don't think there's a big disruption in the U.S. market that justifies (these tariffs),"" Santos added.
Imposing metal tariffs would have repercussions for export-focused companies in Europe. For example, the U.S. is the number one destination for EU car exports both in terms of units (approximately a 20 percent share) and value (almost a 30 percent share).
Exclusion for Europe? European and Japanese trade officials are meeting U.S. counterparts this week as they seek clarity as to what is the basis for being excluded from the new tariffs.
Tweet 1
The U.S. decided to exempt Canada and Mexico from the new duties last week and stated that other countries could potentially also be excluded.
""The issue is that these measures are mainly affecting (U.S.) allies. They claim that the measures are directed to China, but it's basically Canada, EU, Japan, South Korea, these are natural allies of the U.S.,"" Santos said.
""If they exclude all these countries, there aren't many countries left that will be subject to the measures,"" she added.
Meanwhile, European steel and aluminum businesses are reportedly preparing for a collapse in local prices if the tariffs are indeed applied to their region. Charles de Lusignan, from the Steel Association for Europe, told CNBC Monday morning that ultimately the tariffs could mean a scaling back in Europe, with firms letting people go, cutting investment and also innovation.
""We need to act immediately because the damage will be done within the first weeks,"" he said. ""In fact it might already be happening, because obviously an exporter knows that the steel might be blocked in the future so they already start sending it ahead.""
""So we might well see import surges now, even if the measures aren't already in place.""

202,Red-hot chip stocks could see a repeat of 2017 gains,"show chapters Semiconductor stocks surge      7:00 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 03:38 It's been an unpredictable start to the year for chipmakers.
While some like Nvidia have seen double-digit gains, others such as Micron Technology have glitched out.
But, the group could reboot after a mixed start, according to one stock analyst.
""All signs point to yes for semiconductors,"" Kim Forrest of Fort Pitt Capital told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Friday. ""Things are not getting simpler. They're getting more connected and I think anything that helps with that is something that investors should take a look at.""
Already this year, the space as a whole has outpaced broader markets' performance. The SMH semiconductor ETF is up 10 percent for the year to date, while the XLK Technology ETF (in which semiconductors have a 14 percent weighting) has risen 6.7 percent. The S&P 500 has climbed 5.6 percent during the same period.
Gains in 2018 would continue years of outperformance among semiconductor stocks. The SMH rose 36 percent in 2017, its second straight year exceeding the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the XLK advanced 32 percent, a ninth year in the green. Both outpaced the S&P 500's 20 percent gain in 2017.
The outperformance has made individual names in the space expensive, though. Take Nvidia for example – its shares have surged 20 percent since the beginning of the year, quadruple gains by the S&P, putting its price-earnings ratio at 50 times forward earnings.
""I'm not a fan of Nvidia to buy now,"" said Forrest. ""If you have it, you should hold it because it could grow into its PE.""
Others in the space are comparably cheap. Micron Technology currently has a PE ratio of five times forward earnings.
Micron has underperformed the rest of the group in recent months even after rocketing 88 percent higher over 2017. Since hitting its highest levels since 2000 in November, its shares have pulled back roughly 14 percent.
Should it add to those losses, it would raise concerns over the health of the broader semis space, according to Matt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak.
""On a technical basis, it's forming what you call a symmetrical triangle,"" Maley told ""Trading Nation."" If it breaks lower, ""it would be a yellow warning flag, not a red flag, but a warning flag for the group.""

Micron has fallen more days than it has risen in 2018 so far. Even so, its shares have added nearly 4 percent since the beginning of the year. Its peers AMD , Nvidia, and Texas Instruments have all seen double-digit percentage increases this year, while NXP Semiconductors and Broadcom have had gains in the low single-digits.

3510,Larry Kudlow: I'm urging Trump advisor Gary Cohn to stay at the White House,"Larry Kudlow, a confidant of President Donald Trump , told CNBC on Friday he's been urging top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn to stay.
""I have to tell you, personally, I am urging Gary Cohn to stay and fight for another day. He's done a great job,"" said Kudlow, a longtime economist who served in the Reagan administration.
There are multiple media reports casting doubt on Cohn's future in the White House after he was unable to convince Trump not to impose steel and aluminium tariffs. There's been speculation for months about whether or not Cohn may leave his post as director of the National Economic Council.
In a brief gaggle with reporters on Friday morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about whether Cohn is staying. "" I don't have any reason to think otherwise right now."" She added, ""Gary was here yesterday afternoon, I talked to him in my office several times."" 
Sanders also said, Trump is ""pretty committed"" to his announced new policy, saying she did not expect the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum to change. 
Kudlow said on ""Squawk Box"" Trump has done great things like tax cuts and deregulation, but these tariffs are not among them. On Thursday , Kudlow said Trump's tariffs are a ""bad omen"" and could cause ""major calamity.""
Trump announced the new tariffs Thursday, sending stocks into a tailspin, re-approaching their early February lows. Dow futures were down about 200 points on Friday. The president, making good on a campaign promise to protect America's trade interests, is expected to set the tariffs, as early as next week .
""I've had this discussion with the president,"" said Kudlow. ""I've had it for two years-plus. I won a lot of discussions on taxes, on regulations. I have not won any on trade.""
Tariffs are ""prosperity killers"" that will do more harm to the U.S. economy than good, Kudlow said. ""Tariffs damage the user of the commodity, in this case, steel. It's a tax.""
""We're going to have a group going into the Oval [Office] to see him, probably next week to talk it through,"" Kudlow added. 
In a tweet Friday morning, Trump suggested the U.S. would come out on top if the new tariffs were to spark an international trade war. 
@realDonaldTrump When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big. It's easy!

4931,Greece is back in the spotlight as its crucial bailout deadline approaches,"Greece is back on the European agenda as the country rushes to end its third bailout program in August.
The Greek finance chief is due to present Friday new measures for the country, once its emergency assistance program ends. The idea is to convince creditors and the markets that the country will continue with reforms even if it's no longer relying on bailout funds.
Speaking with CNBC Thursday, Klaus Regling, who oversees the European emergency bailout fund (ESM), said he had seen earlier versions of the Greek plan, but it lacked ambition.
""I think (Greece) should be a bit more ambitious in some areas,"" Regling said, citing privatizations as an example.
Though Greece has a lot of work to do in the next four months, presenting a long-term strategy is seen as being just as important.
show chapters Greece could have a 'clean exit in August': European Stability Mechanism 13 Hours Ago | 01:32 ""For me it's much more critical we get a long term perspective,"" Regling told CNBC.

While European politicians have praised the work that Greece has done since 2015, they are still reluctant in giving the country substantial debt relief. The issue has always been controversial mainly for countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Creditors want solid guarantees that Greece will not deviate from the reform path seen up until now in order to make its debt more sustainable.
Greece's public debt ratio is about 180 percent of GDP (gross domestic product). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) still believes that such a ratio is way too big for Greece and will only disburse money to the country once there's a clear plan for the future of this Greek debt.
Pierre Moscovici, European commissioner for economic affairs, told CNBC's Willem Marx Friday that the key to bring the IMF on board is to agree on a mechanism that links the growth rates in Greece to how much interest Athens pays back in that year on its loans.
show chapters Should reach consensus within coming weeks on Greece: French finance minister 12 Hours Ago | 05:16 The idea put forward by the French a couple of months ago basically means that if Greece grows at a slower rate than what's in the creditors' projections, then Greece will pay lower interest in that year. The sticking point seems to be that creditors themselves (both European and the IMF) cannot agree on those growth projections. As a result, the IMF has not joined the program.
The IMF said last year that it would provide Greece with 1.6 billion euros ($1.93 billion) in funding.

Trump has more than 35 million followers on the social media platform. Seven people whom Trump blocked last year sued him over the action. President Donald Trump
They tweeted these insults at President Donald Trump , and now they've beaten Trump — in court.
The ruling came in response to a suit by seven people who had been blocked, personally by Trump, last year on Twitter.
The individuals were joined in their suit by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
A lawyer for the institute said she knows of several hundred people, at least, who have been blocked by Trump on Twitter, but the actual number of blocked accounts is likely much higher.
Below are the people who sued Trump over their being blocked, and the tweets that landed them in the president's crosshairs.

5535,"‘Tired of being told no,’ Trump freezes out chief of staff John Kelly","When President Donald Trump made a congratulatory phone call to Russian leader Vladimir Putin , White House chief of staff John Kelly wasn't on the line.
When Trump tapped John Bolton to be his next national security adviser, Kelly wasn't in the room.
And when Trump spent a Mar-a-Lago weekend stewing over immigration and trade, Kelly wasn't in sight.
Kelly, once empowered to bring order to a turbulent West Wing, has receded from view, his clout diminished, his word less-trusted by staff and his guidance less tolerated by an increasingly go-it-alone president.
Emboldened in his job, Trump has rebelled against Kelly's restrictions and mused about doing away with the chief of staff post entirely. It's all leading White House staffers and Trump allies to believe that Kelly is working on borrowed time.
In recent weeks, Trump has governed at breakneck pace, ousting aides and issuing surprise policy announcements on Twitter, recreating the helter-skelter feel of his first months in office. Kelly's allies maintain that his retreat is strategic. They suggest that the belief that Kelly was Trump's savior was an overstated idea all along and that the chief of staff is now content to loosen the reins and allow an increasingly comfortable president to govern from his gut.
But those close to the president say that Trump has increasingly expressed fatigue at Kelly's attempts to shackle him and that while Trump is not ready to fire Kelly, he has begun gradually freezing out his top aide.
Trump recently told one confidant that he was ""tired of being told no"" by Kelly and has instead chosen to simply not tell Kelly things at all, according to a person who was not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.
In Trump's West Wing, once the rumors begin that an aide's exit is forthcoming, the ""stink"" on that staffer never leaves, according to one of the nearly dozen White House aides, former administration officials and outside advisers who spoke to The Associated Press under the same conditions.
As Kelly's public profile and behind-the-scenes influence has faded, speculation has risen that chaos could return.
""It's not tenable for Kelly to remain in this position so weakened,"" said Chris Whipple, author of ""Gatekeepers,"" a history of modern White House chiefs of staff. ""More than any of his predecessors, Donald Trump needs an empowered chief of staff to tell him what he does not want to hear. Trump wants to run the White House like the 26th floor of Trump Tower, and it's simply not going to work.""
Kelly was once a fixture at the president's side, but Trump has now cut him out of a number of important decisions.
For months, Kelly made it a practice to listen in to many of the president's calls, particularly with world leaders. While he is still on the line for some of those conversations, Kelly was not part of the call Trump made to Putin last month from the White House residence during which Trump ignored advisers' advice against congratulating the Russian president on his re-election.
Although Kelly had agitated for the removal of outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster, he counseled Trump against hiring Bolton, a neo-conservative media commentator. Trump did it anyway, offering the job to Bolton in a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office and telling his chief of staff about it later.
As Trump spent the Easter weekend at his Florida resort and tweeted about his tariffs plan, Kelly was out of state, though the men did consult by phone. While Kelly has fumed about the ethics questions swirling around Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt , Trump was at least initially more supportive of Pruitt, telling him, ""We've got your back.""
The president also has cast aside the constraints the retired four-star Marine general tried to place on Trump about whom he could see and speak to. Those restrictions led shunned advisers to try to undermine the chief of staff in the press and with Trump. For months, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was barred from the White House, only to return when Kelly was overruled by Trump, according to four White House aides and outside advisers.
Many in the West Wing believed that Kelly's attempts to curtail Trump's interactions with Lewandowski, as well as Trump allies such as David Bossie and Anthony Scaramucci, were always destined to fail and alienate the president, who has privately contemplated recreating the freewheeling nature of his campaign and Trump Tower office. Kelly also has clashed with Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who had his security clearance downgraded after a policy change written by the chief of staff.
Some White House aides contend that Kelly has been intentionally giving Trump more leeway to be himself and that Kelly recognizes that's what Trump wants. But allies acknowledged Kelly's receding power and said he's trying to keep his head down and focus on policy, such as the plan to mobilize the National Guard along the U.S. border with Mexico.
The White House declined to make Kelly available for an interview. In public, Trump praises his chief of staff, telling Marines in California last month that Kelly probably ""likes what you do better than what he does, but he's doing a great job.""
The speculation surrounding Kelly echoes the treatment of his predecessor, Reince Priebus, who was the subject of months of questions about how long he would last on the job. Priebus eventually resigned under pressure.
Kelly also no longer commands the same respect among some quarters of the staff. His role came under harsh scrutiny this year over his handling of the controversy surrounding ousted White House aide Rob Porter, who was accused of domestic abuse.
Kelly's shifting version of events elicited frustration from former communications director Hope Hicks, who had been dating Porter, and dismayed a number of West Wing staffers. That episode frustrated Trump, who still remains agitated about an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News months ago in which he suggested that Trump had ""evolved"" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border.
Kelly, who took the job last July, had previously told confidants he hoped to be on the job for a year. One person familiar with his thinking said the chief of staff recently voiced doubt he would make it that far.

1707,Consumers spend more time on Snapchat than Instagram: Report,"Getty Images Evan Spiegel, Snapchat 
While Snap has gotten crushed in the public markets since its IPO last year, a new report suggests that users of the app may spend more time on it than they do on rival Instagram . 
The Daily Beast reviewed Snap's ""confidential"" metrics from April to September 2017. Snap disclosed in its third-quarter earnings report that it had 178 million daily active users , which includes people who create content, look at content and use other features like Discover. 
Here are some of the Daily Beast's findings : Snapchat users spent an average of 34.5 minutes per day on the app in September. Though it was a slight decline from the previous month, the overall trend shows an increase in time spent. Snap had said in May that users spend over 30 minutes on the app. Compare that to Instagram, which said in August that younger users spend about 32 minutes per day on its app. Snapchat users sent about 34.1 messages per day in September. In mid-September, about 125 million people were creating snaps daily on the app, up from 120 million in late April. Most Snap stories get posted on the weekend, with peak activity on Saturday. Publisher-created ""Discover"" editions had about 34 million daily users in September. Snap has previously reported 100 million monthly active users.

5172,Ex-US ambassador warns Trump on Syria and Russia: 'This is not a video game',"7 Hours Ago | 03:59 
Nicholas Burns, formerly U.S. ambassador to NATO, took President Donald Trump to task on Wednesady for taunting Russia about a possible missile strike on Syria. 
""This is not a video game. The president of the United States needs to be calm and needs to act presidential,"" said Burns, who has advised Republican and Democratic presidents and is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ""The tweet this morning was irresponsible. And it wasn't presidential. It wasn't effective."" 
Hours earlier, Trump took to Twitter to strongly suggest a missile strike on Syria in response to its alleged chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town. Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ""smart!"" You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! 
""There's never been an American president going back to the dawn of the nuclear age that was goaded ... like this,"" Burns said on CNBC's "" Squawk Box ."" 
In a second tweet, Trump wrote the U.S. relationship with Russia ""is worse now than it has ever been."" Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race? 
Burns, who has recently been giving Trump credit for diplomatic efforts with China and North Korea, said the White House needs to separate any U.S. response in Syria and the American relationship with Russia, which has been militarily supporting the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad . 
""There's no question that the Russians are wrong to support the Syrian government,"" said Burns. ""They are a real problems for us. But we're talking about airstrikes here."" 
""I will support the use of airstrikes against Syria,"" Burns said. ""But you don't want to mix Russia into this. You don't want the Russians to think the United States is targeting them."" 
""I would separate the two issues. And I believe the president probably is,"" Burns said. ""[But] the president did not do that well this morning."" 
Burns was U.S. ambassador to NATO and the State Department's third-ranking official during George W. Bush 's presidency. He also advised the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton .

Monex's shares spiked 20 percent following the announcement, as of 11:35 a.m. HK/SIN.
Monex, Japan's No.3 online brokerage by customer accounts, said in a statement it would execute the deal on April 16. Coincheck's CEO and COO will resign from the board of directors and become the company's executive directors, Monex said.
Coincheck was hit by a daring $530 million theft of digital money earlier this year, prompting penalties from Japan's financial regulators for lax security protocols.

Both benchmarks have gained about $5 since the start of the week. 
An uptick in oil prices followed incendiary comments from Trump on Wednesday. The U.S. president tweeted missiles "" will be coming ,"" in response to a suspected chemical attack in Syria over the weekend. He has since sought to dial back such explosive rhetoric, raising the prospect that an attack on Syria may not be as imminent as it first appeared.Nonetheless, world leaders continued to mull over military action in the war-torn country on Friday.

""Trump's will-he-or-won't-he antics are here to stay and will, therefore, ensure that the geopolitical risk premium remains alive and well,"" Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note Friday. 
He added oil prices were likely to continue to extend their recent gains in the near term. 
However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Friday it "" remained to be seen "" whether recently elevated oil prices could be sustained. 
In the Paris-based organization's latest monthly report, the group left its forecast for oil demand unchanged at 99.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018. The IEA's outlook for supply also remained the same, as it projected non-OPEC growth to reach 1.8 million bpd this year. Sam Meredith Digital Reporter, CNBC.com Playing",2018-04-13T14:52:00.000+03:00

A publicity stunt encouraging ""crypto enthusiasts"" to climb Mount Everest and bury a hard drive holding $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency reportedly indirectly led to a man's death, the Financial Times said Friday.
Ukrainian social network ASKfm, which is planning to raise money through an initial coin offering, or ICO, sponsored four people to climb Everest and bury the hard drive holding its digital tokens, which at this point have no proven value.

4737,All these wild swings in the stock market could mean it's bottoming soon and will rebound,"At a quick glance, it appears the market hasn't made any progress since it began struggling some nine weeks ago.
The S&P 500 closed on Feb. 5 at 2,648; it finished Tuesday at 2,656, a quarter-percent change in 44 trading sessions. The 10-year Treasury yield ended at 2.8 percent on Feb. 5 and sits right there now. The U.S. dollar index likewise is almost exactly in the same spot as on that first Monday in February — just a week and a half after stocks peaked.
Yet in the intervening weeks, stocks have been gyrating wildly and have featured near-constant quicksilver rallies and sell-offs that reflect indecision and extreme sensitivity to policy and economic news.
The S&P 500 has moved at least 1 percent on nine of the past 12 trading days, an unusual clustering of jumpy action. Partly as a result, the Cboe volatility index (VIX) has remained elevated above 20 for the past 14 days — also an uncommon stretch of heightened agitation outside of a full-blown bear market.
While this might appear a treacherously unstable action, it can just as easily be read as a messy base-building process, taking place a bit above the lows of the correction set on Feb. 9.
The eminent technical analyst Walter Deemer, who gained a wide following at Merrill Lynch, Putnam Investments and his own firm starting in the 1960s, said on Twitter, ""A market that swings violently in both directions without making any net progress is usually a sign of a reversal rather than a consolidation."" By this, he says he means a potential reversal higher following this two-month tailspin.
This emotional saw-toothed action has done some good by skimming away excessive investor optimism, compressing equity valuation and driving professional-investor positioning from heedless aggression to chastened caution. And that's progress of a sort for a market undergoing a correction from overheated levels.
Here's an array of investor-sentiment measures of bullishness and how they've turned much more subdued since Feb. 5. Remember, the broad market itself is at the same level as it was then:
The American Association of Individual Investors: from 45 percent to 32 percent. Daily Sentiment Index of futures traders on S&P 500: 61 percent to 26 percent. Investors Intelligence investment advisors: 66 percent to 48 percent. Ned Davis Research Crowd Sentiment: 76 percent to 57 percent. Meantime, firms that track the positioning of hedge funds are reporting that equity funds have halved their percentage exposure to stocks since the start of the year.
All this might not amount to a truly washed-out, hated market. But it surely shows a lot of hot money has either gone up in smoke or has cooled off, making the market somewhat less vulnerable to a quick shock.
Canaccord Genuity strategist Tony Dwyer, who called for a rough patch before the downturn began, says, ""The two-month intermediate-term correction has been driven by correcting a historical level of optimism rather than a significant change in our positive fundamental thesis.""
One indication this hasn't been mainly a fundamentally based market adjustment: The popular explanation for the weakness ""keeps changing.""
First, it was said to be all about wage inflation and rising bond yields, then it was a blowup in ""short volatility funds,"" followed by trade-policy tensions and the threat of Big Tech regulation.
Further support for the idea that fundamentals aren't eroding significantly is the generally firm behavior of credit markets. While short-term funding costs are rising and financial conditions tightening from very loose levels, corporate-credit spreads suggest no serious economic weakness or financial contagion is stressing the system yet.
The damage below the surface of the stock market has been real, though. By the end of Monday, with the S&P 500 itself down, more than one-fifth of the stocks in the index were down at least 20 percent from their 52-week highs, while two-thirds were off more than 10 percent.
This is happening as aggregate earnings forecasts have continued to rise. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has slid from 18.6 on Jan. 26 to 17 on Feb. 5 to 16.2 entering this week — and 16.2 also happens to be exactly the five-year average multiple.
Again, stocks are not outright cheap, especially with liquidity and credit conditions likely having peaked for now and policy risks higher along several fronts (Fed, regulation, trade). But they are certainly reasonable, as profits appear poised to rise nicely in coming quarters.
It's probably telling that the market has been in this box consumed by tech-regulation fears and volatility-trading fund implosions and trade anxieties in the two months between earnings seasons.
The earnings season about to start is the relatively rare reporting period where good numbers might actually be a straightforward catalyst for a plurality/majority of stocks. Typically in the past couple years, markets would rise into earnings and then we'd get lots of churn and sell-the-news responses.
Perhaps it's understandable that traders seem eager to set aside the always-overblown trade-war concerns to refocus on corporate results.
On the flip side, if better-than-expected earnings can't lift a market that looks cheaper after nine weeks of struggle, it could be a tell that the market is in the grip of something a bit more serious than a curtailment of over-extended optimism and valuation, after all.",2018-04-11T16:28:00.000+03:00
4097,Should you pay on a first date? An etiquette expert weighs in,"First dates can be nerve-wracking. And when you make it to the point where it's time to pick up the bill, things can get even more stressful. Who's supposed to reach for the check? Do you split it?
CNBC Make It turned to Lizzie Post, etiquette expert at The Emily Post Institute , to help you figure out exactly what to do.
""We really believe it's the person who does the asking who should do the paying,"" says Post. ""Or at least who should be prepared to offer to pay."" They should also be open to the idea of splitting the date, ""if the person who was asked on the date offers that up as an option.""
That's not to say you have to ask to split the bill if you were the one asked out, says Post. That comes down to personal preference.
The one thing to absolutely avoid doing on a first date is to view the moment when the check comes as a test. ""A lot of people think that it's OK when the bill comes to watch and just see if both parties actually try and take care of it,"" Post tells CNBC Make It. Using it as a measure of character is unnecessary: ""People are already nervous on a first date. People forget their own names sometimes, and you're going to judge them on the bill?""
show chapters Couples disclose their largest unexpected expense 10:43 AM ET Tue, 21 Feb 2017 | 04:24 Ultimately, the goal is to make the other person feel comfortable, but there's not always a clear-cut strategy for how to do that.
After all, ""some people feel really strongly about paying in full for that first date and really treating someone to a date,"" says Post. ""And other people feel really strongly about splitting it so that there's no feeling of obligation. It's this one moment where you kind of have to feel each other out.""
There's also nothing wrong with a budget-friendly date that avoids the bill situation altogether, she adds: ""Dates can be lots of things so, if you're on a real budget, going for a walk can be a really great date.""
If you're out for dinner or drinks though, don't read into things too much. ""Just be understanding and recognize that just because someone doesn't want you to pay for a first date, doesn't mean they aren't interested in date number two,"" says Post. ""Or, the vice versa of that is, just because someone wants to pay for a date doesn't mean you have to marry them.""

698,Fed's Kaplan warns of unemployment 'overshoot' that could lead to a recession,"The unemployment rate in the U.S. is on its way to below 4 percent, a level that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan believes is an ""overshoot"" of full employment and a potential danger sign for the economy.
Consequently, he thinks the central bank ought to keep raising rates, at least three times this year, as a way to stop the economy from overheating.
""I have more conviction that we're going to get down into the 3s in terms of headline unemployment. We're going to overshoot full employment,"" Kaplan said CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in a live interview.
""The history of overshooting full employment in this country has not been a happy one,"" he added. ""Normally, what happens is you get an overheating, the Fed has to play catch up, and what happens then is you tend to often have a recession.""
Kaplan is a nonvoting member on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
He said he has increased his estimate for economic growth this year and now sees GDP growing at up to 2.75 percent, a forecast that mirrors one that New York Fed President William Dudley made Thursday.
However, he sees the Fed playing a central role in making sure growth doesn't get out of hand.
""In my view, the best way to prolong this expansion is for us to move now in a gradual way, but to continue to remove accommodation, and I think that gives us the best chance to extend this expansion,"" he said.

7295,"As the broad market rallies, Dow stock Exxon could be the ultimate catch-up trade","show chapters As the broad market rallies, Dow stock Exxon Mobil could be the ultimate catch-up trade 20 Hours Ago | 01:22 The markets are testing key levels, and the next move could set the tone for the rest of the year.
I'm watching to see if the S&P 500 can break more meaningfully above its trend line from the January highs. If it can, I think it will present a great opportunity for investors to adjust their portfolios for what I think will continue to be a volatile year for stocks.
Yes, the stock market has seen a nice rally in the last week, but the S&P is still up less than 2 percent since the beginning of the year. It is also up less than 2 percent since earnings season began, even though first-quarter earnings are going to be up well over 20 percent! The inability of the stock market to rally in a more meaningful fashion in the face of great earnings raises a cautionary flag in our opinion.
Yes, the stock market could certainly rally back toward its January highs, but I think the reason it hasn't been able to rally more strongly during this earnings season is because several key developments have changed the landscape since January (when the market was priced for perfection). We have concerns over trade wars, or at least increased tensions on that front), concerns over higher regulation on technology companies, a flatter yield curve, higher short-term rates and a Fed that is shrinking its balance sheet. In other words, we now have things that could offset the positive impact the tax bill will have toward future earnings.
These issues also raise the uncertainties in the marketplace. And markets hate uncertainty. Uncertainty also leads to an increase in volatility. Therefore, we believe that investors should consider rebalancing their portfolios a bit so they can take advantage of any pickup in this volatility. First, with short-term rates giving you yields above 2 percent, raising a small amount of cash is not a bad idea. (Let's face it, Warren Buffett has over $100 billion in short-term bills.) This will give people some ammunition to buy stocks if we get another sharp downdraft like we saw in February.
Second, move some of your investments into stocks that not only pay a good dividend but also have a great record of growing their dividends at a consistent pace. These names will help you ride out this period of uncertainty and volatility, let you participate in any upside in the market, and pay you while you wait!
A great example is Exxon Mobil . This stock has lagged the rally in the oil stocks and the broad market. It was the subject of a bullish cover story last weekend in Barron's , which highlighted the company's plan to double its earnings by 2025 and the stock yields by 4.3 percent (more than twice the yield on the S&P 500).
This stock is now testing its 200-day moving average and its April highs. So if it can break meaningfully above those levels, it should gain the kind of momentum that will help it catch up to the rest of the group. So the upside potential is high even though it's a conservative play.

2999,"Lockheed Martin expects to be ‘on every mission to Mars,' CEO says","Lockheed Martin expects to be ‘on every mission to Mars,’ CEO says 03/07/2018 Facebook 
The race to Mars is on and a new generation of space companies are providing a challenge to incumbents. 
Lockheed Martin is one of several legacy companies working to be a part of future Mars missions, while SpaceX and its founder Elon Musk are pushing to begin colonizing Mars as early as 2022. Despite the newcomers, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson is undaunted in her outlook for the company’s future in space. 
“In terms of being the first to Mars, we have been on every Mars mission for it from the very first one,” Hewson told CNBC. “I think we will continue to be on every mission to Mars.” 
After the successful maiden flight of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, Musk told reporters he wants “a new space race.” Falcon Heavy — more powerful than any other rocket available and at a fraction of the price of any competitor — can launch payloads as far as “Pluto and beyond,” Musk has said. But SpaceX is continuing work on its BFR program, which the company hopes will become the backbone of its Mars program. 
Hewson pointed to two of Lockheed Martin’s ongoing projects for NASA as backing for her declaration that the company will remain on any future Mars missions: the InSight lander and the Orion deep space capsule. The former is set to launch this May, while the latter awaits its first flight aboard the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket in 2020. 
Insight will assesses “the environment of Mars,” Hewson noted, while Orion is not anticipated to make the trip to Mars until after several SLS flights. The deep space capsule will fly uncrewed until at least 2022, when the second SLS mission is expected to take four astronauts around the Moon. 
“Someday, it’ll be going to Mars,” Hewson said of Orion. 
In the same manner as Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg on Feb. 15 , she offered a measure of praise to the new commercial ventures in space, which received a record amount of private investment last year . 
“The new entrants into that over the last several years have helped to raise a lot of the excitement and innovation and I think that’s great for the space program,” Hewson said. 
“It’s great for attracting talent into the space programs that we’re working on,” Hewson added.

3696,'Don't do it': Top corporate brass tell CNBC survey that Trump's trade war is a mistake,"6 Hours Ago | 01:50 
U.S. trade policy has risen to the top of the list of ""biggest external risks"" facing the members of the CNBC Global CFO Council. 
More than a quarter (27.3 percent) of council members responding to a quarterly poll say U.S. trade policy is now the biggest risk their company faces. That's up from 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, outranking other threats that have recently ranked high among business concerns, including ""threat of cyberattack"" and ""consumer demand."" 
The CNBC Global CFO Council represents some of the largest public and private companies in the world, collectively managing more than $4.5 trillion in market capitalization across a wide variety of sectors. 
The survey was conducted after President Donald Trump signed a pair of proclamations that impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum , but before the announcement on Thursday that the United States will seek trade penalties of up to $60 billion against China for intellectual property theft. Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks before signing a presidential memorandum targeting China's economic aggression in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 22, 2018. 
CFOs voiced strong opposition to metals tariffs, especially in the broader context: potential retaliatory moves taken by other countries. ""The impact direct from steel/aluminum tariffs would be negligible,"" said one CFO respondent. ""The indirect impact from retaliation could be significant."" 
Almost two-thirds of respondents (65.8 percent) say the tariffs will have a negative impact on their companies, and even more (86.9 percent) say they will have a negative impact on both the U.S. and Chinese economies. 
The CFO Council's outlook for GDP has been downgraded amid the increased tariff fears, including in three key global economies. Canada, China and Japan were downgraded from ""improving"" to ""stable"" by CFOs. 
Still, the United States was rated as ""improving"" for the seventh straight quarter, while the Euro zone was seen as ""improving"" for the fourth straight quarter. No region was seen as worse than ""stable,"" a trend that has now held for five quarters.

* Soybeans tick up after three-day fall 
* USDA expected to raise U.S. soy stocks outlook on Friday 
* Wheat eases after gains on expected fall in U.S. acreage 
* Subdued grain market also eying weekly U.S. export sales 
(Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline) PARIS/SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures edged higher on Thursday as the market paused following three sessions of declines and ahead of U.S. government crop data expected to show rising stocks. Wheat dipped for the first time in three sessions as traders weighed up the prospect of a further drop in U.S. wheat sowings against stiff export competition in a well supplied global market. Corn was almost unchanged. Grain markets are bracing for crop reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday, with analysts notably expecting the USDA to boost U.S. soybean stocks after a record-large harvest and faltering exports. Investors were also awaiting weekly U.S. export sales data at 1330 GMT for an update on overseas demand. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active soybean contract edged up a quarter of a cent to $9.55-1/4 a bushel by 1244 GMT. On Wednesday, prices hit their lowest since Dec. 22 at $9.51-3/4. ""U.S. soybean exports are surprisingly slow and I think it is because of quality issues,"" said one India-based agricultural commodities analyst at an international bank. ""It is difficult for U.S. soybean exports to recover now as Brazilian new-crop supplies will hit the market at the beginning of February."" Brazilian soybean output is expected to reach 114 million tonnes in 2017/18, almost matching last year's record crop, consultancy AgRural said. CBOT wheat inched down 0.5 percent to $4.32-1/4 a bushel, consolidating after a near-one week high touched during the previous session. Corn ticked up 0.1 percent to $3.49-1/4 a bushel. Expectations that the USDA will peg U.S. winter wheat seedings below last season's level in its first estimate on Friday have lent some support to wheat prices following recent weather concerns in the U.S. Plains. However, weather risks were not seen as severe enough to shake up a global market with large inventories and strong export competition led by Russia. Farming agency FranceAgriMer lowered its forecast for French soft wheat exports outside the EU this season for a third straight month on Wednesday, predicting 9.3 million tonnes versus 9.5 million last month. ""This number looks optimistic considering the current pace of shipments and the large volumes exported by Russia, added to the high competitiveness of Argentinian origins,"" consultancy Agritel said in a note.

3457,Stocks of big manufacturers that use metals plunge on Trump's tariff plan,"Venture Capital Stocks of big manufacturers that use metals plunge on Trump's tariff plan President Trump says he is a champion of manufacturing, but his steel tariff plan is worrying Wall Street. Crane machinery and equipment manufacturer Manitowoc shares declined by nearly 10 percent since Wednesday's close, while rival Terex fell by more than 7 percent in the same time period. ""Tariffs are a broad negative for big steel users in the Machinery space, [and] yesterday's announcement turned a potential negative into reality,"" Baird analyst Mircea Dobre writes. CNBC.com Eddie Seal | Bloomberg | Getty Images Welders cut beams for the substructure of a new oil and gas drilling rig at the Orion Drilling Co. manufacturing and fabrication facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
President Trump says he is a champion of manufacturing, but his steel and aluminum tariff plan is driving a big sell-off in the industry's shares. 
Multiple Wall Street banks cautioned clients against investing in the American manufacturing industry Friday as some of the nation's largest machinery companies are dropping. 
Crane machinery and equipment manufacturer Manitowoc's shares declined by nearly 10 percent since Wednesday's close, while rival Terex fell by more than 7 percent in the same time period. 
""Tariffs may limit President Trump's quest to be 'the greatest jobs president that God ever created,' at least within the U.S. counties that rely on machinery,"" Barclays analyst Adam Seiden quipped. ""The Peterson Institute projects job losses in many key areas of Trump's political base that happens to align with areas of outsized machinery manufacturing assets."" 
Trump announced his plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum Thursday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling more than 500 points since Wednesday. 
Based on Barclays' analysis, cranes and aerial work platforms could have the toughest time dealing with higher steel prices. Agriculture equipment, though, could offset raw material headwinds with pricing of their own.

But Barclays wasn't alone in sounding the alarm on manufacturing companies in light of Trump's tariff decision. Baird analysts were also on edge Friday. 
""Tariffs are a broad negative for big steel users in the Machinery space, [and] yesterday's announcement turned a potential negative into reality,"" wrote Baird analyst Mircea Dobre. ""Longer term, companies will find ways to cope yet for the next few quarters this action will further strain supply chains and pressure margins at a point in the cycle where profit ramp is key."" 
Dobre downgraded a host of manufacturers to a neutral rating – including Terex , Oshkosh and Hyster-Yale – while also cutting his price targets for the companies. 
Terex's stock declined 4 percent Friday. Vehicle body-maker Oshkosh shares dropped 2 percent Friday and are down nearly 8 percent for the week. 
""Imports have played a growing role in meeting U.S. steel demand in spite of repeated attempts by the U.S. Government to limit import penetration,"" added Dobre. ""The reason for this is simple: foreign steel is cheaper and we're not just talking about China, we're talking about everyone."" ",2018-03-02T20:16:00.000+02:00
3581,Sears soars on lower-than-expected fall in comparable sales,"Sears Holdings on Wednesday reported a smaller-than-anticipated decline in same-store sales for the holiday quarter following an earnings pre-announcement last month , sending its shares up as much as 17 percent after hours.
The company also announced that on Wednesday it secured a loan of $440 million to use toward a $407 million payment into its pension plans, unleashing 140 of Sears' properties from a ring-fence agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It said those properties alone have an appraised value of nearly $980 million.
CEO Eddie Lampert said the department store chain made ""progress"" in 2017, having entered into a partnership with Amazon to sell Kenmore appliances and DieHard merchandise, expanding its Shop Your Way loyalty program, selling off under-performing assets and improving overall liquidity.
""We will work to build on the progress we made in 2017, including ongoing actions to improve or close unprofitable stores and to unlock the value in our assets,"" Lampert said in a statement.
Sears' net income totaled $182 million, or $1.69 per share, for the quarter ended Feb. 3, compared with a loss of $607 million, or $5.67 a share, one year ago. The latest quarter's results included a $470 million gain due to new U.S. tax legislation, as well as a $72 million charge related to the impairment of the Sears trade name .
Revenue fell nearly 28 percent to $4.38 billion, as the company operated fewer locations across the U.S.
Same-store sales dropped 15.6 percent overall, while analysts were calling for a drop of 16.4 percent, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Same-store sales for the Kmart banner were down 12.2 percent, while Sears' same-store sales fell 18.1 percent.
Looking to 2018, CFO Rob Riecker said Sears is planning for annual cost reductions of $200 million, which aren't related to store closures.
The company operated 1,002 stores in total at the end of fiscal 2017, compared with 1,430 a year ago. Already this year, Sears announced it will be closing more than 100 additional stores by April. On Wednesday, though, the company said it will open more smaller concept stores later this year.
""In addition to pursuing several transactions to adjust our capital structure in order to enhance our liquidity and financial position, we are taking incremental actions to further streamline our operations to drive profitability,"" Riecker said in a statement.
Sears has managed to trim its long-term debt to $3.2 billion from $4.2 billion a year ago.
The company had $182 million in cash and equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter, down from $286 million one year earlier. Sears has used roughly $648 million of its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility due in 2020.
As of Wednesday's market close, Sears shares have fallen more than 72 percent from a year ago.

American Express announced it will be temporarily suspending its buyback program after the recent tax overhaul. 
In the company's Thursday earnings release, CEO Ken Chenault said AmEx will suspend its buyback program for the first half of the year. The CEO said the company made this decision to rebuild its capital because of the upfront charge triggered by the new tax law. 
He said, however, that the company will continue to pay its quarterly dividend. Chenault said he believes the new tax law will ultimately have a positive effect on both the U.S. economy and the company. 
American Express also reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday. 
Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: $1.58 vs. $1.54 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $8.84 billion vs. $8.72 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters 
The company's stock dipped nearly 2 percent after the company released its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In October, the company announced that Chenault would be retiring in February. Chenault will be succeeded by current Vice Chairman Stephen Squeri. 
Berkshire Hathaway's legendary value investor and longtime AmEx stakeholder Warren Buffett praised Chenault's impact on the company. 
""Ken built on its storied history — not by abandoning traditional strengths, but by building on them and adding new ones,"" Buffett said. 
The company is expected to benefit from the tax reform legislation recently passed by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. In its first analyst report on the financial services giant, Deutsche Bank gave AmEx a ""buy"" rating due in part to the anticipated effects of tax reform and deregulation.

Here's a breakdown of the biggest numbers in Friday's nonfarm payroll report for April:
1. The good : The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent during the month, the lowest level since December 2000, while black unemployment dropped to an all-time low 6.6 percent.
2. The bad : Total job creation of 164,000 and wage growth of 2.6 percent on a year-over-year both were below economist expectations.
3. The ugly : Another 410,000 folks dropped out of the workforce, bringing the total to 95.74 million — a big reason for the dropping headline unemployment rate.
4. More numbers : Professional and business services led job creation with 54,000, manufacturing and health care contributed 24,000 each and mining increased by 8,000.

5616,Kushner Cos. is subpoenaed by the feds following a report the company filed dozens of false documents,"Kushner Cos. subpoenaed by feds after AP report Published 7 Hours Ago The Associated Press Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images Ivanka Trump, daughter of US President Donald Trump, her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to Trump step off Air Force One upon arrival at Rome's Fiumicino Airport on May 23, 2017. 
The Kushner Cos. confirmed Thursday it was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors for information related to an Associated Press report that the company filed dozens of false documents about its buildings in New York City. 
The real estate company issued a statement saying it has ""nothing to hide and is cooperating fully with all legitimate requests for information, including this subpoena."" 
The statement said the federal subpoena came last month, just a day after the AP reported the Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city stating it had zero rent-regulated tenants in buildings across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds. The AP report covered a three-year period when the real estate company was run by Jared Kushner , President Donald Trump's son-in-law who is now a senior adviser. 
Tenant advocates say such false filings allow landlords to avoid heightened city oversight designed to keep lower-paying, rent-regulated tenants from being harassed during construction and pressured to leave, freeing up apartments for higher-paying residents. 
Kushner Cos. told the AP at the time of its report that the company outsources preparation of construction permit applications and fixes any mistakes immediately. Records show the company did file some amended documents, often more than a year later. 
The AP report, based on work by nonprofit watchdog Housing Rights Initiative, has sparked an inquiry by the New York state attorney general's office and a city council investigation. 
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Thursday that the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn had subpoenaed housing paperwork from the company. The office declined to comment to the AP 
The Brooklyn attorney's office also has reportedly subpoenaed the Kushner Cos. over a visa-for-investment program to raise money from Chinese investors for its real estate projects. ",2018-04-20T13:04:00.000+03:00
1853,Pennsylvania's top court unveils a new map carving out the state's US congressional voting districts,"Pennsylvania's top court on Monday unveiled a new map carving out the state's U.S. congressional voting districts, imposing a plan it said was based on ""traditional criteria"" after rejecting a proposal drawn up by Republican lawmakers as unconstitutional.
The state Supreme Court had ruled that the Republican plan effectively marginalized likely Democratic voters. As a result, the Republicans have a more than 2-1 advantage in the state's U.S. House of Representatives delegation, even though the number of registered Republicans and Democrats in Pennsylvania is roughly even.
The court-imposed plan could help Democrats who want to gain control of the U.S. Congress in the November midterm elections.
The new map ""is composed of congressional districts which follow the traditional redistricting criteria of compactness, contiguity, equality of population, and respect for the integrity of political subdivisions,"" the court's order said .
State Republican leaders condemned the new map, saying the court was usurping the powers of the legislative and executive branches.
""We anticipate further action in federal court"" to challenge the new boundaries, state Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and state House Speaker Mike Turzai said in a statement.
Susan Carty, president of the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, which was among 19 plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said lawmakers should heed the ruling.
""To avoid future gerrymanders and court intervention, the legislature should now work toward creating an independent, impartial and accountable redistricting process,"" she said in a statement.
The justices redrew the boundaries with the help of independent experts after Democratic Governor Tom Wolf last week rejected a proposal drawn by Republican legislative leaders as unfairly skewed in their party's favor.
Legal battles are playing out in several U.S. states over gerrymandering, the process by which district lines are manipulated to favor one party. Pennsylvania has long been seen as one of the worst offenders, with one of its districts nicknamed ""Goofy Kicking Donald Duck,"" a reference to a cartoon image evoked by its odd shape.
Pennsylvania is a hotly contested swing state, and the redistricting is expected to boost Democrats' chances of winning several of the U.S. House seats in the state in November.
Democrats must gain 24 seats nationwide to take control of the House from Republicans. Republicans hold 13 of Pennsylvania's 18 congressional seats.
The new map means that Democrats could win up to 11 seats in Pennsylvania in midterm elections, said Michael Li, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school, which filed an amicus brief in the case.
""This is the map that many people think is natural for Pennsylvania, which is a 50-50 state, a classic battleground, but hasn't performed that way in terms of congressional elections for decades,"" he said by telephone.
The Republican-controlled legislature created the current map in 2011, after the 2010 U.S. census. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Republicans' appeal of the state court's ruling in January striking down the boundaries.",2018-02-20T15:37:00.000+02:00
5232,One of Wall Street's biggest bulls calls for downturn's end — sees stocks rallying 13%,"While the stock market gets rocked by intense bouts of volatility , one of Wall Street's biggest bulls refuses to be swayed.
Oppenheimer Asset Management's John Stoltzfus believes the downturn is in its final days and predicts the S&P 500 could surge by almost 13 percent from Wednesday's close.
""We think stocks will work their way to 3,000 by the end of the year,"" the firm's chief investment strategist said Wednesday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" ""We are looking for another good year.""
That's the same S&P 500 target he issued just before 2018 began. The concerns driving stocks into correction territory didn't push him into the bear camp in February, and they aren't doing so now. He believes the issues are temporary.
""The market is likely to calm down once it gets a good signal of some resolution that's livable within the trade area, and we get to see the effects of tax reform come on board,"" Stoltzfus said.
According to Stoltzfus, the uncertainty will likely be swept away by a strong first quarter earnings season, which starts a week from Friday.
""We've had five or six quarters in a row now with earnings expanding. We should see an increase in earnings growth coming up,"" said Stoltzfus, who contends market and economic fundamentals remain solid.
His latest thoughts came as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were battling back from a deficit of more than 1 percent — ultimately closing in positive territory. The Dow did the same thing with a 2 percent early daily loss.
Stoltzfus, who's overweight U.S. equities, predicts financials , technology, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks will help lead the market back to historic highs.

3763,Walmart unit Jet.com taps Tesco veteran Simon Belsham as president,"Walmart 's Jet.com has named Tesco veteran Simon Belsham as president of the e-commerce company, effective immediately, the company said Monday.

Belsham will be responsible for expanding the company's online grocery business, Walmart e-commerce CEO Marc Lore said in a memo to employees.
Belsham spent seven years at Tesco, one of Britain's top grocery retailers, and worked at U.K.-based Ocado, helping the online supermarket company expand its nonfood business. 
He succeeds Liza Landsman, who announced plans recently to leave Jet.com and join a venture capital firm. 
""There are so many ways technology can change retail and be a force for good in our lives,"" Belsham said in a statement about his new position. ""In my view, there is no business better positioned to take advantage of the opportunity ahead than the combination of Walmart and Jet."" 
Belsham joins Jet.com at a time when Walmart is ramping up its online grocery business in the face of competition from Amazon -owned Whole Foods, Kroger and Target . 
In its most recent quarter, Walmart's e-commerce growth cooled significantly, disappointing investors and analysts about Jet.com's performance. Walmart acquired the company in 2016. 
Lore has said Jet.com aims to target consumers in urban markets who might not frequent Walmart stores. Late last year it launched its own private-label brand, Uniquely J , in a bid to win more of those shoppers' dollars and boost profit margins. 
""With Jet Grocery being an integral part of the strategy, Simon brings incredible experience in scaling grocery delivery and his unique background in converging technology and retail to create amazing experiences for customers,"" Lore said in the memo.
Current Jet.com execs Andrew Gasper, David Echegoyen and Jack Hanlon will report to Belsham, Lore said.",2018-03-26T16:10:00.000+03:00

Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said the central bank needs to take a wait-and-see attitude over the impact of the Trump administration's proposed tariffs.
The levies could be challenged in court or in Congress, Bostic said.
""There has not actually been anything done yet. We have to take a wait-and-see attitude,"" Bostic said. ""The claim that there are national security interests in these tariffs could be challenged.... The Congress could just change the law and say don't do this anymore.""
Meanwhile, Fed Governor Lael Brainard — among the most influential U.S. central bankers — said the threat to apply punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports poses an uncertainty for the Fed.

She added, though, that it is too early to determine what will come of all the talk.
""There may be some uncertainty associated with possible developments in this area because it's early to tell what the broader implications could be.""
""I see it as an uncertainty but not something that would materially change my outlook today,"" she added.
Separately, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in Houston that anything that would hurt relationships with trading partners such as Mexico and Canada would be against the interest of the U.S., even as he declined to directly comment on President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
""My sensitivity would be, any actions we could take as a country to jeopardize those relationships are not in our interest,"" he said.
Asked if he would change his forecast to reflect any expected impact from the tariffs, Kaplan said no.
""It's still too soon to say what policies are going to be implemented — my job is not to analyze or overly comment on hypotheticals,"" he said.

7247,Cramer: 5 reasons the stock market rebounded,"The stock market rebound on Wednesday was yet another example of panic being replaced by rationality, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.
""We forget why people fled from high quality stocks in droves yesterday, even stocks that had nothing to do with Italy,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said. ""For the record, that's pretty much every American company having nothing to do with Italy, aside from a handful of players.""
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 306.33 points, or 1.26 percent, closing at 24,667.78. The S&P 500 ended 1.27 percent higher and the Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.9 percent.
The action followed Tuesday's selloff on concerns about Italy's political uncertainty.
The euro zone's third-largest economy has been without a government since an inconclusive vote in March. On Sunday, President Sergio Mattarella refused to accept the nomination of a euroskeptic candidate for economy minister. Instead, he appointed former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister, rattling global markets .
Cramer believes there are five reasons the market came back on Wednesday.
1. We are not in Italy If you listened to the bears on Tuesday, it sounded like Wall Street was located in Rome, Cramer said.
However, ""anyone who thinks that Italy is a functioning state with a real live banking system is kidding themselves,"" he said.
Italians want a better government and solvent, competitive banks, he added. But more importantly, they are ""sick and tried"" of a strong euro, which hurts the tourism business.
""That's the cause of the latest fracas: Italy loses far more than it gains from the euro—I think they'd be better off with their own currency—and they really don't like the EU's heavy-handed approach to just about everything,"" said Cramer.
2. Strong economy = higher stock prices Because of the strength of the U.S. economy, investors are ""getting some incredible returns from great American companies that do most of their business domestically,"" the Mad Money host said
""Selling these stocks because of Italian woes is just as stupid as selling them because of the credit rating of New Jersey or Illinois.""
3. America's natural resources The United States is ""booming"" in part because of its natural resource base, Cramer said.
While it's more concentrated in certain states not as spread out across the country as he'd like, it explains why the employment situation is robust, he added.
4. Easing of regulations Doing business overseas requires navigating through a dense ""thicket"" of regulations. However, things are easing up in the U.S., Cramer said.
""Now that the Trump administration is slashing regulations left and right, or at least taking a very hands off attitude for enforcing the rules it can't get rid of, America has become an even easier place to hire people and grow your business.""
5. Our banks are not like Italy's What got Cramer so upset on Tuesday was that many combined the problems of Italy's banking systems with that of the U.S.
""There is one similarity: they both involve capital. But that's where the similarity ends because most Italian banks — and European banks for that matter — are radically undercapitalized, while our banks are insanely overcapitalized,"" he explained.
The bottom line Wednesday's action was proof that selling on a European pullback is a mistake, said Cramer.
""America is not Italy. New York is not Rome. Our banks are not their banks,"" he said.
""It's easy to remember this stuff when we're rallying like today, but please try not to forget the next time we get slammed off of something that has nothing to do with the United States.""

At the same time, the investment bank increased its rating on competitor Advanced Micro Devices .
""While we may be early on this, we believe the upgrade cycle may peak in 2H18,"" analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note Wednesday. ""Longer term, we have a positive view on Intel's strategy for transitioning to a data-centric company from PC-centric though this may take years to develop.""
Cassidy lowered his rating on the Dow Jones industrial average component to hold from buy and maintained his price target of $53. Cassidy's target implies a 6 percent upside from Wednesday's close of $49.99.
The stock was up 0.9 percent on Thursday at $50.44.
The analyst also said Intel's advantage in the processor space has ""degraded,"" and competitor Advanced Micro Devices was catching up. ""While we understand that process technologies may not be exact comparisons, we find it increasingly difficult to see Intel's process advantage,"" he said.
In a separate note Wednesday, Cassidy upgraded AMD's stock to buy from hold as its valuation looks attractive.
""We believe the market has oversold the AMD shares based on alternative crypto-currency mining solutions coming to market,"" the analyst said. AMD chips have been widely used to mine digital currencies.
Cassidy also sees an opportunity for AMD to increase its market share in the PC space, noting the company ""now has a full line-up of PC CPUs.""
AMD rose 2.9 percent Thursday to $10.07, nearly 30 percent below Stifel's price target of $13 a share.

3743,"Apple, Amazon and Alphabet make up 10% of the stock market and that's made the bull far too reliant on tech","The market has changed. A couple weeks ago, it was all about tariffs and China trade wars. Now, there's new uncertainty around earnings and how it may impact the market leader, technology.
A social media crisis with Facebook that may also affect other social media stocks and Alphabet potentially as well. Driverless-car issues affecting Nvidia and Tesla (which got a downgrade from Moody's). Apple getting hit after Goldman cut iPhone sales estimates.
And now word President Trump doesn't like Amazon (as if that is a surprise).
Here's the problem: Technology has gotten way too big for its britches. It's so big that as tech goes, so goes the S&P 500. And that is very risky.
Here's one way to look at it: The three biggest stocks in the S&P 500 by market capitalization — Apple, Amazon and Alphabet — have a market cap of $2.3 trillion. The S&P 500 has a total market cap of about $23 trillion.
Think about this: Three stocks now make up 10 percent of the entire S&P 500.
Throw in Microsoft and Facebook — which together have a market cap of $1.1 trillion — and the Big Five tech stocks make up 15 percent of the S&P 500.
Wait — it gets worse. Here's a breakdown of the market cap of the S&P sectors:
S&P 500: Market Cap
Technology 25% Financials 15% Health Care, Industrials, Discretionary, Staples: 45% Energy, Materials, Utilities, REITs, Telecom: 15% The first thing to notice: Technology is 25 percent of the S&P, so it's really true — as goes tech, so goes the S&P 500. Combine it with financials (mostly banks), and those two groups make up 40 percent of the S&P 500.
Now look at the bottom group: Energy, materials, utilities, REITs, telecom are only 15 percent of the S&P 500 — just five sectors.
It's fine if you want to rotate out of tech and buy utilities, but if you are owning large swaths of the market in the form of mutual funds or ETFs — and I mean owning the S&P 500 — they are not going to matter much.
What does matter is what I call the ""swing groups"" — health care, industrials, consumer discretionary and consumer staples — that make up 45 percent of the S&P 500. These are the groups that really matter, because if technology and financials falter, as they are doing now, these four are the only ones with the ""heft"" that will make a difference.
They are the ones investors will rotate into, providing the market is healthy and earnings are rising.
Here's the problem: The big earnings growth is in technology (expected to grow 23 percent in the first quarter) and financials (24 percent). Health care and industrials have earnings growth in the mid-teens, consumer discretionary and consumer staples only have about 9 percent earnings growth.
See the problem?
The biggest market cap sectors have the biggest earnings growth. That's why the market is so vulnerable to a sell-off when the earnings quality of its largest group is called into question.",2018-03-28T19:00:00.000+03:00

1998,Don't celebrate that big refund ... it means you've overpaid on taxes,"A large tax refund may feel like free money. It isn't.
This year about 7 out of 10 taxpayers will get some money back from Uncle Sam. 
Early bird filers who submitted their returns when tax season opened Jan. 29 may get their money in the coming weeks.
The IRS expects to receive nearly 155 million tax returns this season.
Many tax refund recipients plan to put that money to work.
About a third of taxpayers getting a refund expect to save or invest the money, while nearly 3 in 10 will pay down debt, according to Bankrate.com .
Here's the bad news: If the IRS sends you a huge check this spring, it means you've likely overpaid on taxes throughout the year.
""A large refund from the IRS may seem like an advantage, but it isn't the best or most effective use of your cash flow,"" said Tim Steffen, director advanced planning at Robert W. Baird & Co.
""You're basically giving the IRS an interest-free loan,"" he said.
Know your withholding If you're an employee, your employer gave you a Form W-4 when you were hired, which you can adjust to make sure the right amount of income tax is withheld from your paycheck.
On the form, you'll make note of your spouse, your dependents and your filing status; these are your ""personal allowances."" The more allowances you have, the less tax will be withheld.
""Some people read the form and think, 'I'm married and have three kids,'"" said Cari Weston, director of tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. ""They end up with five allowances and owe substantial taxes at the end of the year.""
To make things more complicated, the IRS is making internal tweaks to reflect the changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The agency released new withholding tables , which take effect this year. 
The IRS is also working on a calculator and a new Form W-4 to help you figure out the correct withholding based on the new tax code.
Tax uncertainty Use your 2017 tax return to get an idea of how much you ought to withhold this year. 
To ensure that you avoid a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes, you should aim to pay in 2018 at least 100 percent of the prior year's liability, said Jeffrey Levine, CEO and director of financial planning at BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, New York.
show chapters People are waiting for their tax refund check to take care of their health      10:13 AM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 | 01:38 This doesn't mean that you won't owe in April 2019. Rather, it means the IRS won't charge you the penalty and interest next year for coming up short on your taxes.
""If you see your tax rate increase substantially, you might owe a larger amount over the withholding,"" said Levine. ""Aim for that 100 percent: It's a better method of avoiding the underpayment penalty.""
Tailor your tax load
Here's how to evaluate your withholding and make sure it's just right for you.
Review your W-4: Striking a balance for withholding will be based on your salary, your spouse's earnings and the tax bracket you're in. 

We're in a year with many changes to the withholding table, plus a reduction in federal income tax rates. You may be taking home a slightly larger paycheck, but you should make sure you aren't withholding too few taxes . Talk to your accountant: Filers who withheld fewer taxes because they itemized on their returns will need to revisit their withholding. That's because the new law does away with a lot of itemized deductions and places a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions .

Fewer filers are expected to itemize in 2018 because the new tax law has doubled the standard deduction. Under the previous law, about 49 million taxpayers — roughly 3 in 10 individuals — filed itemized returns, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center .
If you fall into that category, you may need to update your allowances in 2018 to ensure you're withholding the right amount of tax.
Calculating your withholding is more complicated if you have multiple sources of income: distributions from retirement accounts or cash from a rental property. You'll need to make estimated quarterly tax payments in those cases, Steffen said.

""Work with a CPA to do a projection and figure out what your tax liability will be at the end of the year,"" he said. ""In a perfect scenario, you'll have a balance due when you file your return, but not one that's large enough to create a penalty.""
Avoid tax arbitrage: If you withhold less in taxes because you have bigger plans with your paycheck, bear in mind that you'll owe Uncle Sam next year. Don't gamble your cash.

""Some people do foolish things: 'If I invest the money and make 7 percent this year, and I beat the IRS' penalty, then I'm ahead,'"" said Levine. ""If you've deliberately underpaid, the money should go someplace safe because this is a really short time horizon,"" he said. More from Personal Finance

The airline had struggled to increase the amount of revenue it brings in for each seat it flies a mile, a key industry metric, but this rose 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter from a year-earlier period, slightly beating a previous forecast of flat per-seat revenue.

The country's economic transformation is lifting prospects, higher oil prices are enriching government coffers — and its inclusion into global benchmarks will bring in more foreign money, said Krithika Subramanian, a research analyst at Credit Suisse Private Banking.
All of that mean that markets in Saudi Arabia are in for a rally, even after a 15 percent rise year-to-date and with some stocks already looking expensive, she said

""We would see, with the FTSE and the MSCI inclusion, almost $15 billion of foreign inflows coming into Saudi Arabia,"" she said.
The economic environment is also turning in favor of the Middle Eastern country, Subramanian said, with the current higher oil prices giving the government more leg room to increase spending and boost growth.
And with higher interest rates on the horizon, Saudi banks will see profitability improve too, she noted, adding that the petrochemical industry and banking stocks are preferred picks.

5353,Top MBA programs beef up cyrptocurrency courses to keep up with demand,"Some of the top MBA programs in the world are adjusting their curriculum after last year's mania around bitcoin . Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, and Georgetown University are expanding classes in digital currency and blockchain to keep up with demand from students and their future employers.
The Stanford Graduate School of Business, ranked no. 1 in the world by the Financial Times this year, is adding a new full-time course in May. The class, called ""cryptocurrency"", was a grass-roots effort by students, according to one MBA candidate.
Itamar Orr, second-year student leading the charge to create more crypto-related courses, said there were a few of them at Stanford, but none of them were continuous.
""They were always pop-ups."" 
show chapters These college students are mining cryptocurrency in their dorm rooms      9:30 AM ET Sun, 1 April 2018 | 03:15 When the Israeli native realized there were no crypto courses listed for 2018, he rallied 12 classmates and sent a letter addressed to professors and associates of the business school.
""Many of us will have to discuss blockchain at our jobs, it makes sense to teach it,"" said Orr. ""It gets you a competitive advantage, it's an extra hammer in your toolbox.""
Stanford agreed, and added the course, which closed with more than 50 people on the waiting list, according to the university site .
Part of the interest comes from Stanford's funnel into venture capital. Of the 32 percent of MBA graduates who chose to go into finance, 7 percent went to venture capital, according to the university's 2017 employment report . VC was the second-most popular choice behind private equity at 15 percent. Only one percent of graduates went into investment banking.
Venture capital investment in blockchain startups increased by 88 percent year over year in 2017, reaching $911 million, according to data from Pitchbook.
Interest from Stanford students has increased in lockstep, according to Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business Susan Athey, who teaches the new class. Athey, who is also on the boards of Ripple , Lending Club, Expedia , and Rover said the curiosity is partially thanks to bitcoin.

Bitcoin rose 1,369 percent in 2017, nearing $20,000 in December. The cryptocurrency was trading below $7,000 as of Wednesday, and is down more than 50 percent this year. Blockchain is the distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, and companies like IBM are testing its use for payments and other activities.

Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which is ranked no.1 by Forbes and no. 3 by U.S. News and World Report, is also adding a class in the fall. ""Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Distributed Ledger Technology"" will be taught for the first time as of 2018 by professor Kevin Werbach.
There was no question of student interest in blockchain and crypto at the Philadelphia business school, Werbach said. But before adding a course, he needed proof that cryptocurrency and blockchain was more than a fad, and was relevant to business students. 
""We're at the point where there's a critical mass to teach this domain,"" he said. ""There will be a real phenomenon in business for the foreseeable future, and five years down the road there won't be too many major business schools that don't offer similar classes.""
Werbach pointed to Wharton alumni working at crypto and blockchain start-ups Ripple, Bitmain, and Coinbase, all of which he guessed would recruit students who eschew careers on Wall Street.
It's not just venture capital and cryptocurrency exchanges looking for the a deep knowledge of blockchain. 
John Jacobs, executive director of Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, said Wall Street and consulting firms that recruit out of the D.C. schools are also demanding a new skill set. The former Nasdaq executive said he is ""constantly"" getting calls from recruiters saying ""you need to train them, we need people to understand how to apply blockchain technology.""
""Any world class program is going to have to equip students in this field to compete,"" Jacobs said. ""It's everywhere we turn around.""",2018-04-05T19:43:00.000+03:00
3748,Bill Gates and Richard Branson are betting lab-grown meat may be the food of the future,"Vegetarians have long touted the ethical and environmental problems with meat production and consumption. Start-ups such as MosaMeat, JUST and Memphis Meats are tissue-engineering meat in a lab to allow people to enjoy being a carnivore without any of the environmental or ethical hang-ups.
Dubbed clean meat, the efforts are distinct from ""fake meat,"" like the soy protein ""chicken"" you can find in your grocery store today. Unlike Morningstar or Boca Burgers, clean meat really is meat; it just grows in a lab instead of being part of an animal. But lab-grown meat leads most skeptical diners to think of a big hurdle: taste.
""When they taste the product, they have to have the experience of meat, not the experience of a product that looks like meat and comes close to meat or has the distinct hints of something that looks like meat,"" said Peter Verstrate, the CEO of MosaMeat. ""It just has to be meat.""
""The ultimate filter is, 'Does it taste exactly like the meat you're used to?'"" said Josh Tetrick, CEO of clean meat start-up JUST, who already tasted success with JUST Mayo.
There are two business-world barometers for clean-meat products that are make-or-break as well: price and scale.
Right now clean meat is much more expensive to produce than traditional meat because of scaling and infrastructure. The land, feed, farmers, slaughterhouses and transportation are already in place to produce meat from dead animals. Growing clean meat may be more efficient and will require less total marginal costs in the end, but until the systems needed to grow clean meat on a large scale exist, it will be more expensive.
Bill Gates: No way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people Investors aren't deterred by the challenges, with sustainability forecasts chief among their concerns and motivations. Scientists estimate the world population will reach 9.6 billion by the year 2050 . This population will increasingly live in urban areas and have a rising middle class, both of which mean more meat consumption. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations , world food production will need to increase 70 percent. Feeding that many people with traditional meat production will require double the amount of deforestation, which will increase greenhouse-gas emissions by 77 percent.
Bill Gates has invested in lab-grown meat companies, as has Richard Branson. ""Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,"" Gates wrote on his personal blog, Gatesnotes.com, a few years ago. ""Put simply, there's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people. Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. That's why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources.""
""There's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people. Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. That's why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources."" -Bill Gates Meat production is wildly inefficient. It takes more than 38 pounds of feed to produce 1 pound of beef. That same pound of beef requires 1,799 gallons of water . We give 20 times the amount of grain needed to eliminate world hunger to farm animals instead . If the population grows according to forecasts and land disappears, the simple fact is we won't be able to keep producing meat. There won't be enough water to feed 2 billion more people eating meat. Lab-grown meat requires 100 times less land and 5.5 times less water than traditional meat.
Paul Shapiro, author of Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World, says the first clean burger in 2013 cost about $300,000 dollars . Although the price is closing in on around $11 a burger, there is still a ways to go.
At $50 a pound, foie gras is made for the lab The price and scale issues have led clean-meat companies to aim in both directions, developing laboratory-grown replacements for cheaper grocery-store staples, like ground meat products — burgers, chicken nuggets — and also steak tips. Current versions already contain filler ( some of which are unsettling ), so clean-meat companies will have an easier time making them. But foie gras, the incredibly expensive and controversial dish made from fatty duck liver, is also a potential success story.
In addition to more conventional products, JUST (formerly Hampton Creek) is experimenting with foie gras. Animal rights activists have fought foie gras production for years, because the luxury food requires producers to force-feed ducks with a pipe so they eat enough to enlarge the liver. (The duck livers must be 10 times larger than normal.)
Foie gras costs an estimated $50 per pound . Because the meat is so expensive, it is a good industry for clean-meat companies to start disrupting. ""That is something we're looking at,"" Tetrick said.
It doesn't cost JUST any more to make gourmet foods than it does to make chicken nuggets. The company's high prices won't make as much of a difference if it's competing with a food that's already very expensive.
JUST is working to scale its meat production so it can move out of a lab setting. Bruce Friedrich, the CEO and co-founder of a think tank accelerator called The Good Food Institute , estimates clean-meat products will be available at a high price within two to three years, and he believes they will be cost-competitive within 10 years.
Friedrich knows that until the infrastructure for clean meat is in place, companies will have to stay creative. ""The soft opening will absolutely be at high price points,"" he said. ""Certainly, foie gras is one way of going about that.""
The problem, however, may be that the type of person willing to pay top dollar for such a controversial food is probably not likely to be interested in an environmentally and ethically friendly alternative. Verstrate understands the foie gras strategy but has different plans.
""Foie gras is a really emotional product for meat eaters,"" Verstrate said. ""I don't think you would stand much chance in France or Spain with foie gras from a lab.""
MosaMeat plans to start with burgers in high-end restaurants, where it can be price-competitive.
Both Tyson Foods and Cargill have invested in clean-meat company Memphis Meats , alongside billionaires Gates and Branson.
""It's a train that's leaving the station,"" Verstrate said of the need for the established meat giants to invest early. ""It's relatively cheap to buy a train ticket today.""
Tom Hayes, the president and CEO of Tyson Foods, said in a statement earlier this year: ""A protein strategy inclusive of alternative forms is intuitive for Tyson Foods. It's another step toward giving today's consumers what they want and feeding tomorrow's consumers sustainably for years to come.""
When digital cameras became available, Canon invested heavily and Kodak did not . Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2011. ""Everybody wants to be Canon; nobody wants to be Kodak,"" Shapiro said.
How clean meat is made Clean meat requires a biopsy from an animal. Scientists can then grow the muscle cells and develop them in a lab the same way the cells would grow on a living organism. To grow clean meat requires what companies call ""growth media,"" a mixture of sugars, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Verstrate compares it to baby food. Clean meat will grow in factories that will resemble a sort of meat brewery. Clean meat will not require the land, water or crops of traditional meat production.
""This is not magic; this is what they're [the cells] made to do,"" Verstrate said.
show chapters Inside the San Francisco lab growing meat in a petri dish 5 Hours Ago | 03:15 Surveys show about a third of the population across the United States and U.K . are willing to try clean meat, but that number could increase if it became more prevalent. Friedrich said the powerful antibiotics in live animals should turn people toward clean meat.
""People are eating meat now despite how it's produced; they're not eating meat because of how it's produced,"" he said. He believes that when the public can choose between two identical products and one is produced safely and humanely while the other is produced in a slaughterhouse, people will choose the former.
Clean-meat advocates and companies believe history is on their side, and it's just a matter of time until people come around. Ice used to come only in frozen blocks taken from lakes ; now we produce ice in the comfort of our kitchen. ""We call it a freezer,"" Shapiro said. ""We don't think there's anything artificial about it at all.""
Others, even among the lab start-ups, are more skeptical. Tetrick thinks meat is trickier than egg-free mayonnaise — JUST's first product — or dairy-free chocolate chips. It's tied to a societal image of toughness. ""Meat is too ensconced in our identity,"" he said. ""We're trying to decouple that.""
For now, JUST's plan is to start small and win people over with a few products. Even if one of those first products, foie gras, is associated with luxury dining, Tetrick said that early success doesn't equal big success.
""If you make meat that only people who shop at Whole Foods can afford, you've done nothing,"" Tetrick said.

4413,McDonald's downgraded because last year's sales success is not the 'norm',"Investors shouldn't get used to McDonald's recent strong sales growth, according to Stephens Inc., which downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight.
""Mid-single-digit comparable growth of recent quarters (especially in U.S.) was a result of successful initiatives coming together at once and should not be considered the norm,"" analyst Will Slabaugh wrote Monday.
While consensus sees 2.9 percent same-store sales growth in 2018 – a key industry metric – Slabaugh argued that modest 2 percent growth is more realistic. He also cut his price target on McDonald's to $170 from $185, implying 5 percent upside over the next 12 months.
Shares of McDonald's fell 0.6 percent in premarket trading following the report. The shares are up 24 percent over the last 12 months.
In its latest quarterly financial report, the restaurant chain reported global same-store sales growing at its fastest pace in six years, climbing 5.5. percent in the final quarter of 2017; U.S. sales growth jumped 4.5 percent, beating consensus estimates.
The company is expected to report first-quarter earnings on April 30. McDonald's did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on this story.
The Stephens downgrade comes amid a slew of initiatives from McDonald's in its attempt to recapture lost customers. Some investors, however, worry that the company's addition of a new $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu may prompt more existing customers to trade down to cheaper menu options.
Company executives have already forecast ""choppy"" results for the current year and have declined to provide investors and analysts with earnings and sales estimates this year. Last year, the company said it wouldn't issue earnings forecasts for two years, saying that an uptick in refranchising across the globe would make further comparisons confusing.
The company's also said it has brought fresh beef Quarter Pounder patties to about 3,500 domestic restaurants so far and plans to reach 14,000 U.S. locations by early May in a larger effort to improve the quality of its food.

4744,South Korean government says would consider peace treaty with North Korea after denuclearization,"A South Korean official on Wednesday said the country would consider negotiating a peace treaty with North Korea following the rogue state's denuclearization, according to local news outlet Yonhap .
That followed daily newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reporting on Tuesday that the two countries were already in talks to announce a permanent end to the officially declared military conflict between them.
Ahead of a summit next week between North Korean premier Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in , lawmakers from the neighboring states were thought to be negotiating the details of a joint statement that could outline an end to the confrontation.
Kim and Moon could also discuss returning the heavily fortified demilitarized zone separating them to its original state, Munhwa Ilbo said.
Pyongyang and Seoul have technically been at war since the 1950-1953 Korean conflict ended with a truce — and not a peace treaty. Geopolitical tensions have occasionally flared up since the armistice, although both countries have so far managed to avoid another devastating conflict.
A successful summit between the Koreas later this month could help pave the way for a meeting between Kim and President Donald Trump . The U.S. president and North Korean leader are poised to hold talks in late May or June, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Despite the talk of a potential peace agreement, there may be some technical roadblocks to such a deal.
For one, Pyongyang does not view Seoul as an authorized participant in peace talks, a former CIA official told CNBC .
""When I met with North Korean officials last year, they said that South Korea is not 'qualified' to participate in peace treaty negotiations because it didn't sign the armistice and didn't have wartime operational control of its forces,"" Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow of Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told CNBC.
""Technically, South Korea is not a signatory to the armistice and a peace treaty would require UN action,"" Klingner added. ""The previous North Korean position has been for three parties – North Korea, China, and the U.S. — to sign a final peace treaty.""

5530,"Trump tariffs are in ‘Stop, or I’ll shoot myself in the foot’ category: Ex-Treasury chief Summers","19 Hours Ago | 03:57 
President Donald Trump 's tariff threats appear to be doing more harm than good to the United States, former Treasury Secretary and Obama administration economic advisor Larry Summers told CNBC Friday. 
""This is a policy that's in the 'Stop, or I'll shoot myself in the foot' category,"" he said on "" Power Lunch ."" 
""This is the first time when we've started making threats that seem to be boomeranging against our own economy. The stock market suggests they're boomeranging against our own economy, the CEOs of major U.S. manufacturing say they're boomeranging against the U.S. economy,"" added Summers, who ran Treasury during Bill Clinton' s presidency and was director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama . 
The escalating trade conflict between the U.S . and China is causing fear among investors about a possible trade war. Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down more than 550 points. 
Trump's latest action came Thursday, when he threatened additional tariffs on $100 billion of China goods . China has promised to ""immediately fight back with a major response."" 
Summers agrees there are ""real problems"" with China and more needs to be done to address issues such as China's intellectual property theft. However, he noted that the Europeans, Japanese and others also have the same issue. 
""The right way to take those problems on is together with other nations, not in a way that is so truculent, so inconsistent with international norms that we drive the rest of the world to siding with China, which has been the effect of the approach that has been taken here,"" he said. 
He also said it shouldn't be done in a way that ""damages the interests of more American firms than are helped."" 
Alan Tonelson, founder of the public policy blog RealityChek, said while he'd like to see the U.S. work with other nations, he called it ""the trade policy equivalent of the unicorn."" 
That's because the U.S.' major trading partners have cut their own deals with China and many directly or indirectly helped China divert a flood of steel into the U.S., he said on "" Closing Bell ."" 
""We have no trade allies,"" said Tonelson. 
Meanwhile, the stock market action isn't helping the U.S.' case, Summers argued. 
""When every time we make a threat our own stock market collapses, it kind of seems unlikely that's going to be a lot of leverage against the Chinese."" 
Earlier Friday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told ""Power Lunch"" the Trump administration is prepared for the chance the trade dispute with China escalates. 
""Our objective is still not to be in a trade war with [China],"" he said. ""I'm cautiously optimistic that we will be able to work this out ... There is the potential of a trade war.""

5575,Beaten Dow stock GE could do something very unusual when it reports earnings next week,"22 Hours Ago | 01:13 
Shares of GE were spiking higher Friday afternoon, and according to some traders, there could be a bigger breakout on its earnings next week. 
The options market is implying an 85 cent move in either direction, or about 6.5 percent, when General Electric reports first-quarter earnings, which is scheduled for next Friday. According to trader Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com, this would be a very unusual occurrence for the stock. 
""You know [GE] has not moved whole lot on earnings,"" Nathan said Thursday on CNBC's "" Fast Money "" ""Partially because we've seen some pre-announcements [and] dividend cuts."" 
Shares of the industrial giant have been in free fall over the past year, now down more than 50 percent. GE has struggled to keep its core businesses afloat, resulting in a series of C-suite shake-ups and a dividend cut last November. 
Nonetheless, some options traders are betting the bottom may be in. On Thursday, call options for GE doubled that of puts. Shares of GE are now positive on the month, and up more than 3 percent in the past week. 
Nathan cautions, however, that even with the stock down more than 20 percent this year, some long-term traders are ""still waiting for a capitulation."" 
""So to me playing next [week's earnings] with defined risk, if you're trying to be contrarian, makes sense,"" Nathan said. 
In addition to reporting earnings next week, the company is also expected to make revisions to its 2016 and 2017 results after the bell on Friday.

709,Do e-cigarettes help or harm? Report says not clear yet,"Do e-cigarettes help or harm? Report says not clear yet By MATTHEW PERRONE, AP Health Writer Published 22 Hours Ago The Associated Press SHARES 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Electronic cigarettes could be a boon to public health or a major liability, depending on whether they help Americans quit smoking or encourage more young people to try traditional cigarettes, a new report concludes. 
The report issued Tuesday wrestles with the potential benefits and harms of the vapor-emitting devices which have been sold in the U.S. for more than a decade. But those effects may not be known for decades, in part, because of how slowly illnesses caused by smoking emerge. 
""In some circumstances, such as their use by non-smoking adolescents and young adults, their adverse effects clearly warrant concern,"" said David Eaton, of the University of Washington, who headed the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee that studied the issue. ""In other cases, such as when adult smokers use them to quit smoking, they offer an opportunity to reduce smoking-related illness."" 
There are no long-term studies on the health consequences of e-cigarettes and little consensus on whether they are effective in helping smokers quit, according to the report requested by the Food and Drug Administration. 
The experts found ""substantial"" evidence that young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try cigarettes. On the other hand, experts found only ""limited evidence"" that cigarettes are effective tools to help adult smokers quit. 
The committee's review of more than 800 studies yielded many findings that were largely in line with prior assessments by other researchers. For instance, the panel found ""conclusive evidence"" that most e-cigarettes contain numerous chemicals that can be toxic. However, there was equally strong evidence that e-cigarettes contain fewer toxicants and at lower levels than regular cigarettes. 
E-cigarettes have been sold in the U.S. since at least 2007. Most devices heat a liquid nicotine solution into vapor and have been promoted to smokers as a less dangerous alternative since they don't have all the chemicals, tar or smoke of regular cigarettes. E-cigarettes and similar vaping devices have grown into a $4 billion-dollar U.S. industry with thousands of varieties of flavors and customizable products available in specialty shops and online. 
The FDA gained authority to regulate the devices in 2016 after years of pushback from the industry. But last year the agency said it would delay the deadline for manufacturers to submit their devices for review until 2022. The decision was blasted by anti-smoking advocates who say some e-cigarette manufacturers target kids with candy and fruit flavors. 
The FDA has signaled its intention to begin pushing U.S. consumers away from traditional cigarettes toward alternative products, such as e-cigarettes. The regulatory delay was intended, in part, to give companies more time to research their products. 
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called the link between e-cigarette use and trying smoking in young people ""troubling."" 
""We need to put novel products like e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to fully evaluate their risks and maximize their potential benefits,"" he said in a statement. 
Some other key takeaways and questions from the report: 
— Chemicals in e-cigarette vapor, such as formaldehyde, are capable of damaging DNA in humans. However, it's unclear if the chemicals exist at levels high enough to cause cancer. 
— Switching completely from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes significantly reduces exposure to numerous cancer-causing chemicals. 
— E-cigarettes can sometimes explode causing burns and injuries. The risk of such accidents is higher with devices that are stored improperly or contain low-quality batteries. 
— There is substantial evidence that e-cigarette vapor contains traces of metal, possibly due to the metallic coils used to heat liquid that the devices vaporize.",2018-01-23T18:34:00.000+02:00
1282,Mester advocates for Fed to use rules-based approach when setting interest rates,"The Federal Reserve should follow rules when communicating policy to give the public a better understanding of the central bank's actions, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday.
A debate has lingered for years over whether the Fed ought to use economic benchmarks as triggers for interest rate hikes and other actions.
In a speech delivered at Rutgers University, Mester did not push for a specific rule to follow. [The Cleveland Fed web site has a list of recommendations for which rules are worth following.]
""I am not advocating setting policy mechanically according to a simple policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances,"" Mester said, according to her prepared remarks. ""However, using the rules as reference points and discussing why our policy may differ from these policy descriptions could go some way in helping to explain our own policy reaction function to the public.""
The suggestion came as part of a larger speech about how the Fed can communicate better with the public.
Particularly during the period of extraordinary policy accommodation — low interest rates and $3.7 trillion of bond buying — the Fed sometimes has struggled to communicate its intentions. That has triggered an effort by some in Congress to audit the Fed, a practice that would force officials to disclose specifically why they made their decisions.
Mester went back even further than the crisis-era policy — to a speech that former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan made, after which The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported conflicting takes on what the Fed ""maestro"" had said about rates.
""I suspect that monetary policy communication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, but over the past couple of decades, the FOMC has been taking significant steps on its journey toward increased transparency and better communication. It is important for the FOMC to continue on this journey because when the public has a better understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, not only will the public have the information it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions but monetary policy itself will be more effective.""
The debate about a rules-based approach has taken on greater prominence amid chatter that President Donald Trump was considering appointing John Taylor, a Stanford economist, as Fed chair. The nomination ultimately went to Jerome Powell .
Taylor developed an eponymous rule that uses certain economic targets to determine where rates should be. The rule currently suggests the fed funds rate should be around 3.4 percent, instead of its target at 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. Many Fed watchers see Taylor remaining as a viable candidate.
In addition to the rules-based approach, Mester also suggested the Fed not focus so much on short-term data changes in its economic projections, and tweaking those projections to link them to where each individual member believes the funds rate should be if those conditions come to fruition.

5864,"The NTSB says it removed Tesla from crash investigation, while Tesla says it withdrew","The National Transportation Safety Board has ""revoked"" Tesla's status as a party to its investigation of a fatal crash that took place in Mountain View, Calif. in March.
However, Tesla maintains it withdrew from the probe.
An Apple engineer named Walter Huang was killed in the March 23rd crash, driving a 2017 Tesla Model X with Tesla 's Autopilot systems engaged.
Huang's family hired a law firm , Minami Tamaki, to explore their legal options, they announced this week. The firm has publicly stated that it believes the Autopilot feature in the Model X potentially caused Huang's death.
The NTSB said in a statement on Thursday:
""The NTSB took this action because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB. Such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.""
In the release, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt wrote, ""We decided to revoke Tesla's party status and informed Mr. Musk in a phone call last evening and via letter today. While we understand the demand for information that parties face during an NTSB investigation, uncoordinated releases of incomplete information do not further transportation safety or serve the public interest.""
The NTSB previously expressed concern about a March 30 blog post from Tesla that suggested Huang was at fault, and included the following:
""In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.""
Tesla told CNBC that it withdrew from the NTSB investigation, and sent an updated statement on Thursday.
""It's been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they're more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety,"" Tesla said. ""Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts. We don't believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress.""
Here is the full statement:
""Last week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement. On Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot — claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true. In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve.
It's been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they're more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety. Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts. We don't believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be.
Something the public may not be aware of is that the NTSB is not a regulatory body, it is an advisory body. The regulatory body for the automotive industry in the US is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with whom we have a strong and positive relationship. After doing a comprehensive study, NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes. Autopilot has improved substantially since then.
When tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category. This was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.""
The NTSB said that revoking party status in investigations is rare, but not unprecedented.

Chipotle Mexican Grill 's food safety woes are still not behind it, and that's good news for other restaurants. 
Despite the burrito chain's efforts to lure back diners, customer perception of the brand remains tarnished and has led them to seek out other food options. 
""Food safety issues likely gave customers a reason to try a new brand or return to more mature brands,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a research note Thursday. ""Particularly in markets where many new and attractive choices exist, it may be challenging to entice prior customers to return or return with the same frequency after experiencing new concepts."" 
Geiger found that 22 percent of more than 1,600 customers polled online by UBS said they ate Chipotle less often because they liked other quick-service options better. This was the second-most-cited reason for customers ditching the chain behind food safety concerns. 
While traditional QSR chains are not typically viewed as Chipotle's direct competition, food safety issues gave customers a reason to try other brands, Geiger said. 
McDonald's received the most benefit from Chipotle's troubles, with 30 percent of respondents reporting that they visited the burger chain following food-safety incidents. 
""Chipotle is a case study in what happens when a brand loses the trust of its consumers,"" David Henkes, principal at Technomic, told CNBC via email. ""The market is too competitive right now, and consumers have so many choices, that once that bond is broken, it's hard to get consumers back."" 
Taco Bell , Panera and Subway were also listed as brands that likely gained visits from lapsed Chipotle customers. Geiger said that Chipotle also likely lost customers to smaller, regional fast-casual concepts that offer similar food quality and experience. 
""A further issue is the price,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, told CNBC via email. ""As the number of offers and deals in fast food have increased, Chipotle has become a relatively more expensive option. That would be fine if quality was seen as good and the menu interesting, but when those elements are missing, it creates a poor value for money perception."" 
Some 22 percent of customers polled by UBS said they ate less at Chipotle because it was too expensive. 
In mid-January, Chipotle completed its last wave of price hikes, raising costs by 5 to 7 percent in its remaining markets that did not already see increases in 2017. Prior to the first price hike in April last year, Chipotle had not raised prices at any of its locations since mid-2014. 
Another 6 percent of respondents called out Chipotle's lack of new menu items. The burrito chain has struggled to create meaningful menu additions, ditching chorizo a little over a year after it launched the new protein. Consumers have also had a tepid response to the restaurant's addition of queso. 
""Despite some menu changes and attempts at innovation, the Chipotle offer is seen as the same and dull by a large number of consumers, this has reduced visit frequency and spend,"" Saunders said. 
Chipotle is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings after the bell on Feb. 6.",2018-02-01T19:56:00.000+02:00
6776,EMERGING MARKETS-Argentine stocks climb after Lebac note auction,"EMERGING MARKETS-Argentine stocks climb after Lebac note auction Published 8 Hours Ago Reuters
SAO PAULO/BUENOS AIRES, May 16 (Reuters) - Argentina's stock market climbed on Wednesday after the central bank held a successful auction of its Lebac notes the previous day, but the peso ended slightly weaker as the bank sold no dollars on the spot market. Late on Tuesday, Argentina's central bank sold 620.93 billion pesos ($26 billion) of short-term Lebac securities at its monthly auction, compared with about 616 billion pesos' worth of securities that matured. That came after the central bank raised the interest rate on the security to about 40 percent, up from 26.3 percent previously. In recent weeks, the Argentine peso has deteriorated rapidly, spurring the government to seek a financing agreement from the International Monetary Fund. On Monday, the currency fell some 6 percent, hitting an all-time low. On Tuesday, however, the peso snapped a losing streak, closing up 3.73 percent after the central bank sold $791 million on the spot market. On Wednesday, the rally briefly continued after the Lebac auction, but ended the day slightly weaker, with the peso down 0.78 percent at 24.29 to the dollar as the central bank did not sell dollars on the spot market.
Argentina's benchmark Merval index closed up more than 3 percent. Elsewhere in the region, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index closed up 1.65 percent, while Mexico's IPC index closed up 0.35 percent. Mexico's peso closed up 0.49 percent after it rallied on the news that independent presidential hopeful Margarita Zavala dropped out of the race, which some think could help a business-friendly candidate.

1306,Chamber of Commerce CEO Donohue: Leaving NAFTA would mean 'absolute destruction' for the US economy,"4 Hours Ago | 01:25 
The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Wednesday that NAFTA is a vital part of the U.S. economy, and scrapping it would be a mistake. 
""To pull out of NAFTA would be an absolute destruction to the advances we've made on the economy and economic growth,"" Tom Donohue said on CNBC's "" Squawk Alley ."" 
""We can't do that. We can improve it. We can change it. But we can't get out of it. We can't destroy it,"" he said. 
President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Negotiations enter a sixth round on Jan. 23 in Montreal, leaving many wondering about the future of the deal with Mexico and Canada. 
On Monday, Trump told the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention that changes to NAFTA could hurt farmers. 
""Think about it: When Mexico is making all of that money, when Canada is making all of that money, it's not the easiest negotiation,"" Trump said. ""But we're going to make it fair for you people again."" 
But Donohue, whose organization bills itself as world's largest business group, representing more than 3 million businesses, said he believes Trump understands the importance of the agreement. 
""The bottom line is growth will be weakened, not strengthened or sustained, if we pull back from trade,"" he said. 
Before his appearance on CNBC, Donohue stressed the importance of NAFTA in his annual State of American Business speech in Washington. In his speech, Donohue also warned about a growing backlash against technology. 
Donohue told CNBC that progress is being made on NAFTA and in trade talks with South Korea . 
He said the 24-year-old NAFTA pact helps secure America's borders and that it affects 14 million American jobs and involves about $1.3 trillion in trade. 
""It's a program that keeps us safe within on our borders because of the people we're in a trading arrangement with,"" he said. Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Playing ",2018-01-10T21:15:00.000+02:00

5504,These are the cities where the biggest midterm campaign donations are coming from,"With control of Congress up for grabs in November, several rich donors are already lining up to spend big in districts they may never even visit, let alone step into the local voting booth.
Campaign contributions from these long-distance donors are already flooding into some of the most competitive districts in the country, hoping to sway the outcome of the midterms.
Just as much of this campaign cash is coming from just a handful of individuals, the biggest of those donors are concentrated in just a few areas of the country.
show chapters Will tax reform save the GOP in mid-terms? 3:23 PM ET Tue, 17 April 2018 | 02:48 As of the first quarter, the 100 top individual donors to the upcoming House and Senate elections contributed a combined $154 million, according to a tally of campaign finance records by the Center for Responsive Politics. Of that amount, more than half came from just the top 12 donors on the list.
So far in this cycle, about two-thirds of all individual political campaign contributions of $200 or more have come from about one-quarter of 1 percent of American voters. (Smaller contributions are not required to be itemized with the donor's name and address.)
Overall, individual contributions represent nearly three-quarters of direct campaign spending reported to the Federal Election Commission. The rest comes from political committees that bundle contributions and disburse them to candidates. Most of the biggest committees are based in Washington, D.C., which remains the geographic center of American campaign finance.
Many of the top 100 individual donors are clustered in just a few other major metro areas, including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and South Florida.
As a group, they tilt a bit more toward Republican and conservative candidates, according to the CRP data. So far, about $83 million has been spent on right-leaning candidates, compared with $65 million for Democrats and liberals.
Here are the major metro areas with the biggest pools of long-distance donors.
New York Not surprisingly, the nation's financial capital is also the center of campaign cash supplied by individual donors.
So far this cycle, financier George Soros tops the list, with more than $7 million in donations to Democratic committees and candidates. Billionaire investor Robert Mercer, a backer of conservative causes and the Trump campaign, is also a major donor in this cycle, along with his wife, Diana.
On the Democratic side, James Simons , Mercer's one-time business partner at hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, is among New York's top donors, along with his wife.
Chicago Chicago's biggest individual Republican donor, by a healthy margin, is Richard Uihlein, a Chicago businessman who founded a shipping company with his wife in 1980 after working for a family packaging business founded by his father.
So far in this election cycle, Uihlein and his wife have contributed more than $21 million to Republican and conservative candidates. Since 2010, Uihlein has given nearly $50 million to political organizations, according to Federal Election Commission records compiled by Ballotpedia .
Chicago is also home to Newsweb Chairman Fred Eychaner, a media entrepreneur who has given $4.6 million to Democratic candidates and committees so far this cycle.
San Francisco San Francisco's biggest individual donors, Tom Steyer and his wife , have spent nearly $16 million in the current cycle to support Democratic and liberal candidates, according to CRP. Steyer, a San Francisco investor who retired in 2012 to focus on politics, spent more than $73 million in 2014 and roughly $100 million in 2016, according to Ballotpedia.
Steyer is also leading an initiative called Need to Impeach,which is geared toward influencing Congress to impeach .
Billionaire real estate broker George Marcus and his wife have given $4.3 million to Democrats, as of the end of the first quarter.
Other top San Francisco donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and online brokerage founder Charles Schwab.
South Florida South Florida, which includes Miami, is home to a number of top long-distance political donors, along with other wealthy individuals who enjoy living in one of the seven U.S. states that don't collect income taxes.
Financier Donald Sussman, founder of the hedge fund Paloma Partners, so far tops the list of individual donors in the Sunshine State with more than $8 million in donations to Democratic political candidates and committees.
Other Renaissance Technologies investors, Henry Laufer and his wife, have contributed nearly $3 million to Democrats.
Brothers Jude and Christopher Reyes, founders of a Chicago-based beer and food distributor, have given more than $1 million between them to Republican candidates and committees.

2237,Vloggers created a $205 'Big Mac' with Wagyu beef and Veuve Clicquot—here's everything in it,"The Big Mac is a McDonald's classic. But even classics need an update sometimes.
That's why Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, the hosts of popular YouTube morning show "" Good Mythical Morning ,"" set out to create an updated version of the Big Mac using the finest ingredients they could get their hands on.
Good Mythical Morning ""Will we create a McMasterpiece or a McMonster?"" they ask on a recent episode of ""Good Mythical Morning.""
To assist, the pair enlisted the help of Josh, their ""mythical chef.""
In total, the upgraded Big Mac cost $205.52 to build — a far cry from the burger's typical $3.99 . Here's a look at what went into creating the dish.
Good Mythical Morning The core of any burger is, of course, the meat. For this deluxe sandwich, they used 16 ounces of Wagyu steak from Lone Mountain Ranch , which Josh says is 100 percent DNA-tested and genetically pure. At $89.25, it was the priciest single item in the burger.
After hand-chopping the steak and forming it into two patties, they were cooked with a generous scoop of truffle butter and topped with slices of cheese. ""I've never smelled this going into a Mickey D's,"" Link noted as it browned.
Classic American cheese got an upgrade for this experiment. After melting down slices, Josh combined it with $11 worth of Camembert to create a cheesy hybrid he dubbed ""Camemberican.""
Good Mythical Morning To replace Mickey D's iconic Big Mac sauce, GMM made a version of their own by combining Sir Kensington's brand mayonnaise and mustard, chopped pickles and sea urchin roe.
Once cooked, the burgers, cheese and sauce were layered onto a custom-baked brioche bun from Los Angeles' Lodge Bread , which the GMM team plated in 24-karat gold leaf.
The new and improved ""Big Mac"" was finished off with artisanal gem lettuce, pearl onions and homemade pickles made with Veuve Clicquot champagne.
Good Mythical Morning The finished product not only overtook its namesake in price, but stood twice as tall. But the real question was, how did it taste?
""It's so good! It's so fancy!"" Rhett said after taking his first bite.
""It's still very much a Big Mac,"" Link said. ""All the Big Mac tastes are still hitting me in the proper ratio, even though it's a lot larger.""
The verdict: It works. Watch out, McDonald's.
Good Mythical Morning Here's the full list of what went into the $205.52 price tag:
$89.25 Wagyu steak $4.29 truffle butter $44 sea urchin roe $1.37 mayonnaise $0.95 Mustard $0.85 Bubbies pickles $4.50 brioche roll $11.37 24-karat gold leaf $0.43 American cheese $11.02 Camembert $1.74 gem lettuce $0.49 pearl onions $0.26 cucumber $35 champagne Check out the full video from Good Mythical Morning:

(Recasts with Mexico peso gains, closing prices) MEXICO CITY, April 24 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso bounced back from a steep selloff on Tuesday, boosted by optimism the country would strike a new trade deal with the United States, while worries about elections drove Brazil's currency to a 16-month low. U.S. President Donald Trump said that a new North American Free Trade Agreement could be hatched quickly as officials from Mexico, Canada and the United States held talks in Washington in hopes of tying up a deal in the coming days. Mexico sends around 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor and the currency has whipsawed since Trump's election in late 2016 over the shifting outlook of the NAFTA deal. Mexico's peso gained nearly 0.7 percent, clawing back a day after its worst one-day percentage loss since Trump was elected after promising to scrap the NAFTA deal. Emerging market currencies had broadly weakened on Monday as U.S. Treasury yields shot up to a four-year high, lifted by expectations of a wider fiscal deficit and faster inflation.
After briefly breaching the 3-percent milestone early on Tuesday, yields on benchmark U.S. Treasury notes fell back, rekindling appetite for battered, higher-yield assets. The Colombian peso, which had led losses on Monday on the heels of a crude selloff, strengthened 1 percent as London oil futures earlier broke above $75 a barrel. Analysts thought the gains could be short-lived due to concerns about a faster pace of U.S. rate hikes. The Brazilian real weakened nearly 0.5 percent to close at 3.4685 per dollar, its weakest since December 2016. The currency extended a recent stretch of underperformance as traders fretted over October's election, the country's most uncertain presidential race in decades. Some investors had predicted that the arrest of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was leading polls and had rallied against the current government's austerity platform, would usher in the ascent of more market-friendly candidates. But recent polls have shown the Brazilian electorate as highly fragmented and unsatisfied with the likely candidates, raising doubts over efforts to curb a growing budget deficit. ""Our bullish story was mostly based on (recovering) confidence ... but the election process is not moving in the expected direction,"" strategists at Santander wrote in a client note.

2038,Brazil defense minister to take over public security post,"Brazil defense minister to take over public security post Published 22 Hours Ago Reuters 
BRASILIA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann will become the head of the new Ministry of Public Security that will coordinate efforts between all levels of government to try to curb escalating violence across Brazil, the government announced Monday. 
Jungmann was the top government official involved in the negotiation of a joint venture between Boeing Co and Brazilian planemaker Embraer that is still pending a green light from the country's president. 
Army Reserve General Joaquim Silva e Luna will temporarily take over as the head of the Defense Ministry, a presidential spokesman said. 
Boeing has sought Brazilian government approval of the partnership with Embraer that would create a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense unit, Reuters reported three weeks ago. 
Jungmann was due to make a recommendation to President Michel Temer on the tie-up following Brazil's rejection of a Boeing plan to buy Embraer. 
He will hand over that role to Luna, who has been briefed on the Boeing-Embraer talks, a government official said. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the matter. 
Temer is expected to issue a decree on Tuesday creating the Ministry of Public Security, which will take over the running of Brazil's federal police and other law enforcement agencies from the Ministry of Justice. 
Last month, the federal government ordered the army to take over command of police forces in Rio de Janeiro state as authorities try to control violence and crime driven by heavily armed drug gangs that control many of the metropolitan area's slums.

1663,Macron's China visit points to Beijing's shifting relationship with Europe,"Macron's China visit points to Beijing's shifting relationship with Europe French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped is ""clearly eyeing"" a ""special strategic partnership"" with China, one expert said France's pivot to closer ties could be beneficial for Beijing's ""divide and conquer"" strategy, she said 15 Hours Ago | 02:18 
As French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his first official visit to China , there are signs that Beijing's relationship with Europe is shifting. 
The French politician's first official visit to China is notable for coming as other leaders of the Western world struggle domestically. In fact, Macron appeared as ""perhaps the leader of Europe at this very moment"" said Philippe le Corre, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May , who herself has a China trip set for the end of January, continues to face questions about Brexit and her own leadership; Germany's Angela Merkel is struggling to form a coalition; and the U.S. is facing political turmoil under Donald Trump's administration. 
For his part, Macron is ""clearly eyeing"" a ""special strategic partnership"" with China, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French bank Natixis, pointing to China's consumers grow hungrier for what France has to offer. 
During his campaign, the French leader took a ""slightly negative"" approach to China by pushing for a European-level investment protection agency, but that development seems to have lost ground, Garcia-Herrero said. 
Instead, Macron appears to be taking a different angle with China. 
""Macron seems to have come to the realization that he had better be on the right side of the table under China's divide and conquer strategy in Europe, i.e. a more accommodating stance towards China,"" she wrote. 
As much as Macron is wooing China, Beijing is also reaching out to Europe through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative that aims to connect Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a vast logistics and transport network. 
For China, France's pivot to closer ties could be beneficial for its overall standing in Europe: A ""divide and conquer"" strategy will help diversify its power, as sentiment toward the East Asian giant turns sour in Germany, Garcia-Herrero added. 
That shift comes as China is now producing more of its own machinery and automobiles instead of importing them from countries like Germany — and it's now even competing with the European powerhouse in third markets, she said. Mark Schiefelbein | AFP | Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron (L) and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands after a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 9, 2018. Macron pursued business, downplayed deals 
Over his three-day visit, Macron pursued business interests with China, but he also pushed for a reciprocal trading relationship. 
That came as many in Europe are debating about the implications of Chinese investments in the continent, particularly in infrastructure and higher technology. 
""At the end of the day, Europe is very open. It's more open than the Chinese market itself. Reciprocity is the key word, really. That's what Emmanuel Macron was trying as a message to convey to [Chines President] Xi Jinping ,"" le Corre told CNBC. 
On Tuesday, Macron offered to open France to Chinese investment in exchange for greater access to China's markets for French companies, Reuters reported . 
""We have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,"" Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at an event in Beijing, Reuters reported . 
""If we don't deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides,"" he said. ""Let's open up both instead."" 
On Wednesday, Macron said a contract with China for 184 Airbus A320s would be finalized soon, Reuters reported. 
The French leader downplayed the lack of other big deals during his visit, saying other countries had trumpeted big figures in the past that masked more modest realities.

Weighing in on tech regulation from Recode's Code Conference on Wednesday, Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff rushed to Facebook 's defense. He said the social network shows evidence of a ""cultural shift,"" and executives are now more wary of the negative potential of their platform.
In an interview on Tuesday with Recode's Kara Swisher, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said she and other Facebook leaders ""didn't see coming a different kind of more insidious threat, but once we saw it, we did publish a white paper"" and made some changes. Rascoff felt the interview was evidence of a pivot in thought by leadership at Facebook.
""More important than actual regulation will be that companies take seriously the impact of their platform – and yes, I do think Facebook has realized that,"" Rascoff said on Wednesday.
""I really think that the cultural shift they talked about yesterday is real. You can see it in Sheryl's eyes,"" he added on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" Asa Mathat | Vox Media Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg at Recode Code 2018.
Facebook has come under fire multiple times this year, both for mishandling user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and for failing to control malicious players who used the platform to ""wage information warfare"" in the U.S.
""The Facebook executives I have talked to really have taken this to heart. They feel guilty, they feel that their platform was used in a way that it was not designed for. They really are throwing resources and intellect at the problem,"" Rascoff said
As CEO of Zillow, a tech company breaking into the radical new territory of flipping houses, Rascoff seemed himself wary of regulation, whether it's housing or social media.
""If there is regulation, I want to make sure it is intelligent regulation. We are not off to a great start in that sense,"" Rascoff said.
""One thing that Sheryl said that is worth pointing out, she said frequently regulation entrenches large companies. Let's make sure any regulation we have doesn't prevent the next Facebook that's being, hopefully, developed by two girls in a garage somewhere,"" he added.

Amtrak: Despite our best effort to restore service between BOS and WAS today, we have determined at this time it is not safe to do so. Hazardous conditions for our customers & crews have led us to cancel all Amtrak service on the Northeast Corridor until tomorrow. We sincerely apologize. 
Earlier Friday, Amtrak temporarily suspended service on routes between Boston and Washington until 6 p.m. But as the late winter storm, which brought high winds and a mix of snow and freezing rains to the U.S. Northeast, continued unabated, Amtrak was forced to extend its cancellations.
Amtrak: Amtrak service southbound out of WAS is also suspended until at least tomorrow morning due to multiple downed trees blocking the freight line's tracks that we operate on. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, 
A spokesman for Amtrak services said there was no threat of service in the Chicago area being disrupted due to weather. 
The National Weather Service on Friday at 5:19 p.m. ET issued flood advisory warnings to the New York City area, which are expected to remain in effect until Sunday.
Five people have been killed by storm-related causes, law enforcement officials told NBC.

5739,Hillary Clinton fundraiser loses Port Authority post after video of her cursing out cops goes viral,"A Washington lobbyist who played a leading role in raising money for Hillary Clinton's presidential runs resigned her commissionership at a top transportation agency after being caught cursing out police on video.
""You may shut the f--- up!"" fumed the lobbyist, Caren Turner , at a Tenafly, New Jersey, cop during a March 31 traffic stop of a car in which Turner's daughter had been a passenger.
""You're an ass,"" Turner later told the officer, according to a police report released Wednesday. ""Look at that smug-ass look on your face.""
Turner, 60, had become increasingly frustrated and angry after police politely declined to discuss in detail why they had pulled over that car, which was being impounded after being found to have an expired registration.
A police dashcam video — which has gone viral — shows Turner, who lives in Tenafly, arriving in her own vehicle just as police were finishing up ticketing the driver for violations that included failure to have a current insurance card, driving an unregistered vehicle and driving with the license plate obscured.
And she promptly began taking a peremptory tone, dropping names and mentioning her position as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She also flashed a gold badge from the PA at the cops.
The Port Authority operates all three major New York area airports, river crossings between Manhattan and New Jersey, and the World Trade Center site in New York.
Source: YouTube Turner, who heads her own government and public affairs firm, was appointed the head of the Port Authority's ethics committee last year by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican.
She has raised money for Republicans and Democrats , and in 2008 served on the national finance committee of Clinton's presidential campaign.
Turner did not answer the door at her home on Wednesday when a CNBC reporter knocked. Efforts to reach her by phone for comment were unsuccessful.
Her company's webpage notes that she has been described as having ""an iron fist in a velvet glove,"" and that she ""advocates winning on the merits of the argument, not the contacts.""
But she seemed to do just the opposite in the video.
""No, don't call me 'miss,' I'm 'commissioner, thank you!' Turner snapped at one of the cops as they stood on the side of a road in broad daylight.
""I'm the commissioner of the Port Authority, and I'm heading up over 4,000 police officers.""
""I'm also an attorney,"" she sniffed.
Turner in short order told police she was there ""as a concerned citizen and friend of the mayor"" who has ""been in Tenafly for 25 years,"" that she planned on reporting the officers to Tenafly's police commissioner, and that the occupants of the car included grad students at Yale and MIT.
She also accused the two officers of having ""ruined"" the Easter and Passover weekend ""of a lot of people"" by stopping the car.
""I got all your information, sweetheart,"" Turner told the officer, referring to his name and badge number. ""I got your name.""
""I'm very disappointed in the way you are acting.""
The officer had several times calmly told Turner that she should ask the driver of the car why police had stopped the car. The cop noted that the driver and passengers were adults.
""No, no, no, I need to know,"" Turner pointedly said when the officer explained that the car's driver had all the information about the stop and could tell her what was going on.
At one point, as Turner harangued him, the officer said: ""I just don't appreciate your demeanor. You're being very demanding.""
Later, he asked her to stop walking toward him as he was being forced against the front end of his car to avoid contact with her.
When that cop told her she could take her daughter with her, Turner went ballistic.
""You may not tell me when to take my kid, you may shut the f--- up!"" Turner snapped.
A police report about the incident written by one of the officers notes Turner's ""condescending tone,"" and also that ""she was attempting to misappropriately use her professional position to gain authority in this situation.""
Turner later was seen at Tenafly police headquarters speaking to a dispatcher and then a lieutenant, according to the report.
Tenafly's police chief later contacted the Port Authority about the incident. The PA's inspector general opened an inquiry into Turner's conduct, which led her to resign last Friday.
The Port Authority, in an emailed statement said, ""The video speaks for itself. The conduct was indefensible.""
""The Board takes its recently adopted Code of Ethics for Commissioners extremely seriously and was preparing to form a special committee to review the findings of the Inspector General investigation and take action at this Thursday's Board meeting,"" the PA said. ""Commissioner Turner's resignation was appropriate given her outrageous conduct.""
The PA was rocked in recent years by the ""Bridgegate"" scandal in which a Christie staffer and political appointees conspired to create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey, at the George Washington Bridge. David Samson, the PA's executive director, later pleaded guilty to a crime relating to coercing United Airlines to restart a discontinued flight to South Carolina so Samson could more easily visit his vacation home there.
Tenafly's mayor, Peter Rustin, told CNBC that the conduct of Turner, with whom he is friendly, was ""unfortunate.""
""I support my police officers,"" Rustin said. ""I think they did a good job under the circumstances. It was not an easy situation. I think they showed some restraint.""
New Jersey State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, who had backed Turner's appointment to the Port Authority, said in a prepared statement that ""there are no excuses for what transpired"" on the video.
""Her resignation was appropriate. As was the Port Authority's condemnation of this behavior by a commissioner,"" said Weinberg, a Democrat.
Tenafly Police Chief Robert Chamberlain on Wednesday issued a statement on the incident.
""I want to thank and recognize the Port Authority of NY/NJ for their professionalism and prompt attention to the matter,"" Chamberlain said. ""I would like to thank everyone who reached out to the Tenafly Police Department to offer words of praise and commendation for the two officers seen on the dash cam video involving a motor vehicle stop.""
""The outpouring of support from people across the country has been truly heartfelt. I am extremely proud of the composure, poise and restraint that Officer Savitsky and Officer Casper exhibited that day,"" Chamberlain said. ""I truly believe their professionalism is a representation of the greater law enforcement community and is reflective of new training initiatives to assist
law enforcement personnel in similar situations.""

5147,"More House seats are open than in at least a dozen years, but it's no slam dunk for Democrats","House members are leaving their seats at a rate not seen in at least a dozen years. Yet it remains to be seen how the exodus — particularly on the Republican side — will affect November's fight for control of the chamber. 
The most high-profile departure came earlier this month when House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would not seek re-election as he tries to spend more time with his family . 
GOP incumbents will not run in 39 districts: 26 in which the member of Congress is retiring and 13 in which the representative is seeking a different office, according to data compiled by Daily Kos Elections. Nineteen Democratic seats will be open due to retirements, campaigns for another office and one death. 
The current total of 58 open seats has already topped every election cycle dating back to 2006, according to the Daily Kos data. Tough electoral dynamics for some Republicans and term limits on committee chairmanships have contributed to the high number of departures.
Due to a loss of name recognition or fundraising strength, defending House seats becomes more difficult without an incumbent. However, recent elections suggest the increase in departures may not necessarily lead to a strong 2018 performance for the Democratic Party as it tries to flip the 23 GOP-held seats needed to take a House majority. 
The president's party often struggles in midterm elections, and President Donald Trump 's sluggish approval rating and energetic opposition to his policies may hurt GOP candidates. Those factors may play a bigger role in the 2018 results than retirements, said Steven Billet, director of the legislative affairs program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management. 
Retirements ""allow the other party to be a bit more hopeful"" about their prospects, he said. But he cautioned against using retirements to draw conclusions about November's outcome.
""Obviously, Donald Trump is playing a role here, retirements are playing a role here, the presidential party losing seats in off-year elections is playing a role,"" he said. 
The number of GOP retirements suggests Republicans think the electoral environment will be difficult for them in November, said Molly Reynolds, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. However, she also said it is tough to assess how departures will affect the midterm results. 
""It's difficult to figure out just how big a role the retirement itself plays in determining the outcome, since members who think they might lose are more likely to decide not to run,"" Reynolds said. 
Currently, Democrats have about a 6 percentage point lead in an average of recent polls asking which party voters would prefer in the midterms, according to FiveThirtyEight . That gap has narrowed from about 10 percentage points in January. 
Recent results show no clear trend for House departures alone affecting election outcomes. In 2010, more Republicans left office than Democrats, yet the GOP gained 63 seats and control of the House. It was the first off-year election held during President Barack Obama 's tenure, in which energized opposition to the Affordable Care Act propelled the GOP. 
In 2012, more Democrats departed than Republicans. Democrats picked up a few House seats but failed to gain control of the chamber. Obama won re-election that year. 
Then, in 2014 — another midterm year in which more Republicans left office than Democrats — the GOP again gained seats and kept control of the House. 
This year, races for GOP-held seats without incumbents vary in how competitive they appear. Republicans seem safe in several seats incumbents left, such as Indiana's 6th District, Mississippi's 3rd District, South Carolina's 4th District and at-large seats in both North Dakota and South Dakota. 
But other GOP members of Congress are choosing not to run again in areas considered particularly vulnerable for the party. Those seats include Florida's 27th District and Pennsylvania's newly redrawn 5th, 6th and 7th Districts.",2018-04-19T19:47:00.000+03:00

Lizards with the ability to ""attract atomic waves"" were reportedly used by Western spies to gain intelligence on Iran's nuclear program, a high-ranking Tehran official has claimed. 
Hassan Firuzabadi, senior military advisor to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told local media on Tuesday that he became aware of the special reptiles ""several years ago."" 
In remarks that were widely picked up by international media outlets , Firuzabadi referred to one case involving foreigners who were in the Islamic Republic on an aid mission. 
They possessed lizards and chameleons whose skin attracted atomic waves, he said, adding that the foreigners were ""nuclear spies"" who wanted information on Tehran's uranium mines and atomic activities. 
Firuzabadi also said Western spy agencies had ""failed every time,"" suggesting that the energy-sensitive lizards did not succeed in their mission. WATCH: The dangerous tie between North Korea and Iran show chapters",2018-02-14T05:28:00.000+02:00

6700,Ex-HHS secretary: Trump's push for higher drug prices abroad won't lead to lower US costs,"President Donald Trump 's plan to bring down drug prices at home by forcing higher prices abroad won't work, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said Friday.
Trump unveiled his administration's plan to lower prescription drug prices on Friday. During his speech from the White House, Trump criticized foreign countries for paying less than the U.S. for prescription drugs, saying it's time to end ""global freeloading once and for all.""
Thompson, who spoke in an interview with CNBC's "" Power Lunch "" before Trump's speech, praised the president and the current HHS secretary, Alex Azar , for ""keeping their word"" and addressing the issue of high drug prices in the U.S.
But when asked whether Trump's strategy to raise prices on foreign countries would work, he said, ""Of course it wouldn't.""
""Just raising the prices across the world isn't going to help America,"" said Thompson, who served as HHS secretary from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush . ""It's just going to increase prices for other people.""
Former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who said she spoke with Azar on Thursday about the drug-pricing plan, also took issue with Trump's plan to raise prices on foreign countries. She told ""Power Lunch"" that U.S. drug prices aren't a foreign issue.
""That doesn't do anything for American consumers,"" said Sebelius, who served as HHS secretary under former President Barack Obama . ""There's no question American consumers pay the highest prices in the world. But that's because we don't have a drug-pricing policy.""
On Friday, Trump also criticized drugmakers and middlemen such as pharmacy benefit managers. So-called PBMs negotiate drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.
Earlier Friday, Azar told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" that everybody's gaining something from higher list prices except patients and taxpayers. ""We have to fundamentally examine and re-examine the role of pharmacy benefit managers,"" he added.

3157,How blockchain could save federal agencies billions,"It's hard to misplace $800 million. Yet the Pentagon recently did. The Defense Logistics Agency, which manages military construction projects, lost track of enough money to fill two tractor trailers with $20 bills, according to an internal audit that leaked in February .
The DLA is hardly the only federal organization to face bookkeeping challenges. A recent audit of USASpending.gov -- a federal website created to make government spending more transparent -- found that 302 federal programs failed to report $619 billion in expenditures .
Blockchain could solve these accounting problems and bring an unprecedented level of accuracy, security, and speed to federal record-keeping. By adopting it, the government could eliminate supply chain inefficiencies -- and save billions of dollars.
The federal government has 2 million civilian workers spread across more than 430 agencies, sub-agencies, and departments , and conducts business with thousands of commercial vendors. Any organization that large would naturally struggle to share information and process transactions across departments in a timely, accurate manner.
Even within a single agency, data is often siloed in different databases and stored in different formats. So it's impossible for officials to gain a comprehensive view of their spending and activities.
""This combination of security, speed, and low operational overhead makes blockchain particularly well-suited to address the public sector's information-management challenges."" This haphazard data storage also makes the government vulnerable to security breaches. In 2015, hackers stole sensitive information about 4 million current, former, and prospective employees from the Office of Personnel Management . Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security revealed a similar incident had exposed the data of nearly 250,000 agency employees .
Blockchain would enable the government to securely collect, store, process, and utilize the massive amounts of information it collects, thereby boosting cost effectiveness and transparency.
Blockchain is best known as the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. But its applications go far beyond that. Essentially, blockchain is a tool for recording transactions -- whether they are payments, contracts, orders, or votes -- and storing that information securely on thousands of computers, via a shared ledger or large database.
While most blockchains are public, many organizations -- like those in the banking sector -- are adopting private blockchains to automate operations.
The underlying ledger technology can be rather intimidating. But think of it as a giant Excel spreadsheet that is visible on thousands of computers at once. People can document transactions in a cell, or ""block,"" of the spreadsheet. After a set amount of time, that block will be locked, and a new block -- the next one in the ""chain"" -- will be opened for editing.
Since the locked blocks are viewable on thousands of computers, it'd be nearly impossible to hack the blockchain. Altering a block on a few computers wouldn't affect the others, which retain an accurate record of the transactions.
Blockchain ledgers also enable the creation of ""smart contracts,"" which can automatically process transactions or information from Party A to Party B once the locked blocks show that Party B has performed a requested service for Party A. Blockchain would preserve a transparent record of every aspect of such transactions -- with full auditability and traceability.
This combination of security, speed, and low operational overhead makes blockchain particularly well-suited to address the public sector's information-management challenges. Many governments around the world are already embracing public and private blockchain solutions.
Sweden's government, for instance, is experimenting with blockchain to record land transactions without the need for paper documents, physical signatures, and multiple in-person interactions. The Estonian government currently uses a blockchain technology known as Keyless Signature Infrastructure to protect its sensitive public-sector data from tampering or theft.
Here in the United States, there are plenty of ways the federal government can utilize blockchain.
Agencies could use smart contracts to automate supply chain transactions with vendors or other offices -- while also creating an instant, secure, and auditable record of those exchanges. They can also employ these contracts to develop, test, and deploy new software. Plus, blockchain could open the door to advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Federal organizations ranging the Centers for Disease Control to the Department of Homeland Security to the U.S. Postal Service are evaluating potential applications for the technology . And in February, the House held hearings about how blockchain could improve federal operations .
The government's current data processing, storage and security systems are in need of help -- as the Pentagon's $800 million mishap makes clear. If the government is serious about nixing inefficiencies and finally reducing our national deficit, it'll embrace blockchain.
Commentary by T. Richard Stroupe, Jr., the CEO and co-founder of Sequoia Holdings, Inc. a Washington D.C.-based software company with commercial and government clients.
Disclosure: Sequoia works with government clients but says it does not currently have contracts with any of the agencies mentioned in this piece.

3314,Here are 4 of Stephen Hawking's biggest predictions from human extinction to aliens,"Stephen Hawking was well-known for his work on black holes and the theory of relativity. But, the famous physicist, who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 76, also had some predictions about the future, ranging from topics such as aliens to the end of the world.
Here are some of his most famous predictions.
The earth will turn into a ball of fire Hawking theorized that humans would turn the planet into a giant ball of fire by 2600 due to overcrowding and energy consumption which will make Earth uninhabitable.
As a result, humans will need to go to live on another planet. Hawking said humans will need to colonize another planet within 100 years or face extinction.
""With climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious,"" he said in a BBC documentary last year.
Getty Images Stephen Hawking in 2016 in New York City. Hawking is part of the Breakthrough Starshot initiative, which plans to develop ultra-fast light-powered spacecraft that can look for habitable worlds that might be circling the nearby star, Alpha Centauri.
""Such a system could reach Mars in less than an hour, or reach Pluto in days, pass Voyager in under a week and reach Alpha Centauri in just over 20 years,"" Hawking said at the event.
Hawking's thoughts were similar to SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk . He said last year that there will be an ""extinction event"" if humans stay on Earth, according to an article in the journal New Space. Musk has made it clear that he believes that Mars could be a good alternative to Earth.
Warnings on A.I. In November last year, Hawking said the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) could be the ""worst event in the history of our civilization,"" unless society finds a way to control its development.
The physicist did say that the technology could help eradicate poverty and disease, but admitted its future is uncertain.
""Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don't know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or conceivably destroyed by it,"" Hawking said during the speech.
""Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy.""
Global warming could reach a 'tipping point' In an interview with the BBC last July, Hawking warned that global warming could reach a point where it can't be reversed.
""We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. (President Donald) Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid,"" Hawking said.
The scientist criticized Trump's decision last year to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, saying that it would cause ""environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children.""
There may be aliens out there Given that Hawking spent most of his life looking at space, it's not surprising that he has pondered whether there are other lifeforms out there.
In 2015, Hawking joined Russian billionaire Yuri Milner to launch a project aimed at using high-powered computers to listen for aliens. The project, known as Breakthrough Initiatives, supports SETI@home, a scientific experiment based at the University of California, Berkeley. It uses computers to scan the skies to look for life.
""Somewhere in the cosmos, perhaps, intelligent life may be watching these lights of ours aware of what they mean,"" Hawking said. ""Or do our lights wander a lifeless cosmos, unseen beacons announcing that here on our rock, the universe discovered its existence?.""

5279,Bed Bath & Beyond needs to change its game plan or risk going down faster than expected: Analyst,"2 Hours Ago | 04:02 
Bed Bath & Beyond may be headed for a quicker-than-expected demise if the company doesn't shake things up, Anthony Chukumba, managing director and senior research analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told CNBC. 
""If they remain on their current trajectory, this could be Sears , just 5 to 10 years earlier,"" Chukumba said Thursday on "" Power Lunch ."" 
Bed Bath & Beyond ""should be more aggressive in closing stores"" and building its online presence, he said. 
Its stock plunged more than 18 percent on Thursday after the home goods retailer issued a weak 2018 forecast . 
While Chukumba acknowledged that the company is still profitable, generating positive cash flow and having a ""relatively under-leveraged balance sheet,"" he said it is not closing stores fast enough to continue competing in the digital world. 
""They have talked about closing 40 core Bed Bath & Beyond stores this year. I don't think that's enough,"" he said. ""And they're actually going to open about 20 Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus stores."" 
Bed Bath & Beyond is parent company to both Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus. 
""The problem is that [Bed Bath & Beyond] sells a lot of commodity products, nationally branded products that you can find at other places and in many cases for less,"" Chukumba said. 
In a quarterly, in-house pricing study, Loop Capital Markets found that Bed Bath & Beyond is about 18 or 19 percent more expensive than e-commerce giant Amazon . Bed Bath & Beyond has long been offering coupons of 20 percent off to lure shoppers into stores. But Chukumba said that has only caused margins to drop ""a countless number of quarters year over year."" 
Bed Bath & Beyond stock has declined 23 percent in the last month, 55 percent in the last year, 76 percent down in three years and 74 percent in the last five years. 
Still, Chukumba has a hold rating on the stock rather than a sell. 
""We're just not sure there is significant additional downside here, at least over the next 12 months,"" he said of the discounted stock, which closed at $17.21 on Thursday. 
""They're not going away anytime soon,"" he said.

6668,Sellers are increasingly stripping out luxury homes instead of tricking them out,"3 Hours Ago | 01:04
Thirty-two stories above West Hollywood, Calif., there is a big, empty space. A sweeping, 7,000-square-foot penthouse in the storied, iconic Sierra Towers that has been stripped down to the bare concrete bones.
Listed at $58 million dollars, with sweeping 360 degree terrace views of Los Angeles , the fact that it is empty apparently makes it more valuable.
The new strategy, which is becoming increasingly popular in luxury real estate markets like New York and Los Angeles, is called ""white-boxing."" Strip out all the finishings, all the amenities, even the highest of the high-end kitchens and baths, and then you can charge more for the space.
""A lot of times people will buy something, totally done, beautiful and they'll still rip everything out and start over, so this trend is more, buy it, do whatever you want to do and you don't have to pay to rip out someone else's design,"" said Jade Mills, with Coldwell Banker of Beverly Hills. ""This is much more valuable than buying something and having to rip everything out.""
Not only does it save the buyer time and money, but Mills says it actually makes buyers feel better about the tear out, which they all know is not exactly environmentally sound. They may know they're wasting what was already there, but it's already been done, so they don't have to see that. It's tabula rasa real estate at its finest.
""White boxing is really just having a blank canvas. So you can walk in, you just see the walls, you see the interior space, but you can do whatever you want to that space"" said Mills. Source: CNBC
It can make an older property seem new. And regardless of how iconic the building – the Sierra tower has had residents from Cher to Elton John, high-end buyers want to put their own stamp on whatever they buy.
""There is no appetite for 'off-the-rack' with this demographic; it's all about uber-customization,"" added Josh Greer of Hilton & Hyland, who just began marketing the full-floor penthouse with Mills. ""As recently as a few years ago, it would be relatively rare for a seller to go to market with unfinished luxury space, but now there's increasing recognition that 'designer-ready' is exceedingly more attractive than 'move-in ready' to the ultra-wealthy.""
And more attractive to the architects and designers who will be working on the projects. Source: CNBC
""For us to take a white box and design like this, it's much easier because you get to bring the client here and really breathe the space,"" said Los Angeles architect Gavin Brodin. ""A property is definitely more valuable stripped out.""
Broden said it is also easier to create computer-generated images, virtual renderings of potential designs, when the space is empty. Brodin came up with some potential designs for the Sierra penthouse, so the seller can offer buyers ideas — something to look at beyond the view. He says no matter how high-end the home, most clients will rip out everything inside.
""That happens to us on nine out of 10 projects,"" Broden said.

4636,Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen drops libel suit against Buzzfeed and Fusion GPS over salacious dossier,"President Donald Trump 's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen , on Wednesday dropped a libel suit against BuzzFeed News and intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS over his involvement with a now-infamous dossier alleging collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
""The lawsuits against BuzzFeed over the Steele dossier have never been about the merits of our decision to publish it,"" BuzzFeed said in a statement, referring to British spy Christopher Steele, who was commissioned by Fusion GPS to compile the dossier.
""If there's one thing Democrats and Republicans agree on today, it's that the dossier was an important part of the government's investigation into potential collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia,"" BuzzFeed added. ""Today's news suggests that Donald Trump's personal lawyer no longer thinks an attack on the free press is worth his time.""
Letting go of the defamation suit could give Cohen more time to focus on a number of high-profile cases against him.
show chapters Michael Cohen drama captures White House attention 8:28 AM ET Tue, 17 April 2018 | 04:03 A California judge on Wednesday scheduled a hearing for porn star Stormy Daniels' lawsuit against Trump and Cohen, in which Daniels seeks to void a nondisclosure pact negotiated by Cohen barring her from discussing an alleged affair with Trump. The hearing is set for Friday morning.
On Monday, Cohen for the first time attended court proceedings regarding an ongoing investigation into potential financial crimes and acts of concealment . A week earlier, Cohen's properties were raided by FBI agents based on a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating purported Russian links to Trump's presidential campaign. The seized materials include documents related to Daniels and communication between Trump and Cohen.
In a statement, Cohen's attorney David Schwartz said, ""the decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one.""
""We believe the defendants defamed my client, and vindicating Mr. Cohen's rights was — and still remains — important. But given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention, and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits,"" Schwartz said.
Cohen is referenced heavily in the 35-page dossier , and is accused of attending a ""secret liaison with the Kremlin"" in Prague, among other allegations.
The dossier had reportedly been circulating for some time among news outlets before the 2016 election. But its salacious and unverified claims — including that Russian spies held evidence that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a mattress in a Moscow hotel room — were not made public until January, when BuzzFeed published a story about the document.
The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Cohen's withdrawal from the suit.
Cohen denied the dossier's claims about him, famously allowing news outlets to view his passport as evidence that he had ""never been to Prague"" in his life.
A report from McClatchy in April, citing two sources familiar with the special counsel's probe of possible Russian links to Trump's campaign, said that Mueller has evidence that Cohen made a trip to Prague in 2016. Cohen again denied the trip.

3242,Asia looks set to follow Wall Street lower as trade concerns weigh,"Asian markets closed mixed on Thursday, after some regional stock indexes shrugged off early losses. Meanwhile, the dollar and bond yields slipped as concerns over heightened trade tensions lingered. 
The Nikkei 225 edged up by 0.12 percent, or 26.66 points, to close at 21,803.95, reversing losses seen earlier in the day. The broader Topix was little changed on the day. 
Retailers gained ground , while automakers and technology names traded mixed. Despite the broader gains, shippers declined with the Topix sea transport index lower by 1.36 percent. 
Across the Korean Strait, the Kospi added 0.25 percent to end at 2,492.38. 
Symbol Name Price   Change %Change NIKKEI --- HSI --- ASX 200 --- SHANGHAI --- KOSPI --- CNBC 100 --- Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced 0.22 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN. The financials subindex eked out gains on the whole, even though heavyweights HSBC and AIA were down 0.13 percent and 0.22 percent, respectively, an hour before the market close. 
Mainland markets closed mixed. The Shanghai composite finished the session mostly unchanged, closing up 0.01 percent at 3,291.61. The Shenzhen composite slipped 0.22 percent to end at 1,874.41. Meanwhile, consumer stocks were the best-performing sector on the blue chip CSI 300 index, which rose 0.57 percent on the whole. 
Newly listed stocks on the mainland were lower, with names like China Express Airlines down 9.93 percent. The dive in share prices came after a Xinhua report cited regulators saying such stocks were vulnerable to near-term speculation, Reuters said.
In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.24 percent to close at 5,920.80 as losses in the heavily weighted financials subindex, which traded lower by 0.89 percent, weighed on the broader index.
Trade worries in focus Major U.S. stock indexes all recorded declines in the last session as markets digested trade-related developments out of Washington, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 1 percent, or 248.91 points, to close at 24,758.12. 
Shares of Boeing fell 2.5 percent following news of potential trade measures, which could include investment restrictions and indefinite tariffs, being considered against China by President Donald Trump . Trump could implement tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to Reuters. 
The White House on Wednesday also said the Trump administration wanted China to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. by $100 billion, and not the $1 billion figure Trump had tweeted last week. 
Asian stock indexes had closed lower in the last session amid talk of potential additional U.S. tariffs. That overshadowed the release of better-than-expected industrial output and fixed-asset investment data out of China.
The looming possibility of a trade war saw bond yields dip. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 2.8134 percent at 3:09 p.m. HK/SIN after touching as low as 2.797 percent earlier. Yields trade inversely to bond prices.
Against the safe-haven yen , the dollar extended losses to 105.99 amid trade-related worries, below the 106.2 handle seen in the last session.
The dollar index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of rival currencies, stood at 89.693 at 2:36 p.m. HK/SIN.
Larry Kudlow, the Trump administration's newly tapped top economic advisor, on Wednesday told CNBC that ""a great country need[ed] a strong currency ."" 
Those remarks, however, were unlikely to lift the dollar much given how concerns over the possibility of a trade war continued to simmer in the background, wrote Mizuho Bank economist Zhu Huani in a note.
In corporate news, Samsung Electronics said it would start constructing a memory chip production line in China at the end of the month in a bid to enhance its NAND flash technology, Reuters reported. Samsung shares were off by 0.43 percent by the end of the day. 
Elsewhere, Cathay Pacific jumped 4.64 percent by 3:04 p.m. HK/SIN after the airline on Wednesday announced a loss of 1.26 billion Hong Kong dollars ($160 million) in 2017 — smaller than the HK$2.15 billion forecast in a Reuters poll.
Oil prices held onto overnight gains after data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected, while gasoline inventories dropped more than forecast. U.S. crude futures edged up 0.11 percent to trade at $61.03 per barrel and Brent crude futures were nearly flat at $64.90.",2018-03-15T01:32:00.000+02:00
1678,E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce frustrates produce industry,"Lisa Romerein | Getty Images Despite more food-safety inspections and other initiatives over the past decade, the fresh produce industry is dealing with what may be its worst E. coli outbreak linked to leafy greens since 2006.
There's also been a sense of frustration for some in the food industry that more information hasn't been provided by the U.S. government.
A deadly strain of the E. coli bacteria possibly linked to romaine lettuce has sickened nearly 60 people and killed at least two in the U.S. and Canada, although U.S. health officials are still trying to nail down the source of the outbreak. Canada's public health agency, though, has said romaine lettuce is the source of its outbreak and advised its population to avoid consuming the leafy vegetable.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is investigating illnesses in at least 13 states and indicated the outbreak started in mid-November and cases continued through Dec. 8 . One of the deaths from the outbreak was in California, according to a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health.
""Leafy greens tend to have little nooks and crannies where it's hard to wash off bacteria,"" said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports.
According to Halloran, this appears to be the worst E. coli outbreak linked to leafy greens since 2006, when contaminated baby spinach sickened at least 205 people and killed three.
E. coli can get on fresh produce by fecal contamination from wild animals, nearby livestock or even humans, say experts. The contamination can occur in the soil or water and happen on the farm itself or in the processing of the fresh produce.
Consumer Reports recommends U.S. consumers temporarily steer clear of the romaine lettuce. But the CDC said it is still trying to determine the origin of the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections and hasn't issued any formal recommendation to stop eating romaine lettuce.
""We've been able to do some really detailed DNA fingerprinting of the bacteria and the outbreak in Canada and the outbreak in the United States,"" Matthew Wise, an epidemiologist and CDC response team leader, told CNBC on Friday.
Wise said the bacteria found on both sides of the border appear to be ""really closely related to one another."" To be clear, though, he said more data needs to be collected in the U.S. to determine if romaine lettuce is the source of the domestic outbreak.
However, some food industry veterans contacted for this story expressed frustration that more information hasn't been provided by the federal government and suggested the response has been perhaps slower than it should have been.
""We don't have any information beyond what the Canadian government and the CDC have put out,"" said Scott Horsfall, CEO of the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA), a food-safety program formed a decade ago in the wake of the deadly spinach E. coli outbreak. ""It's pretty frustrating, actually. So we don't have any insights what may have happened.""
CDC's Wise defended the agency's handling and said, ""Canada has many more illnesses in their outbreak investigation. They have linked that to Romaine. We're working really hard to ... confirm whether or not that's the case also in the U.S.""
Wise said the CDC is collaborating closely with the Canadian authorities ""on a weekly basis.""
Meantime, some industry experts said the shelf life of romaine lettuce is just a few days and so any contaminated product is probably long gone from supermarket shelves or restaurants.
""If this outbreak is actually confirmed to be caused by romaine lettuce, it's important to recognize this is a highly perishable product with limited usable shelf life and it's highly unlikely a specific affected lot would still be available for sale or in a home refrigerator,"" said Jon Dinsmore, a grower in Yuma, Arizona.
Together, California and Arizona grow about 90 percent of the leafy green vegetables produced domestically. Mexico also imports product into the United States.
Under the LGMA program, regular on-farm inspections are conducted and it certifies that grower or shipper members are in compliance with food-safety standards. There's a similar program operating in Arizona.
The 2006 spinach outbreak was linked to contamination from cattle fecal matter found near a California spinach farm, according to state and federal officials.
Among the other changes since 2006 are the Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in January 2011. It is considered the most significant update to U.S. food safety rules since the 1930s.
Regardless, some experts concede even tougher rules and self-policing programs by farmers and shippers probably won't ever eliminate the risk entirely.
""Anytime you have a raw agricultural product, they can get contaminated, and you can have these kind of outbreaks,"" said Bill Marler, a Seattle-based foodborne illness attorney.
In 2011, melons contaminated with listeria were blamed for sickening nearly 150 people, and 33 died as a result. Also, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report issued in November said there have been foodborne illnesses linked to other fresh produce, including cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts, bean sprouts and packaged salad products.
Marler, though, does credit the Obama-era legislation with helping to bring some change.
Contamination ""is actually significantly less than what it was in the early part of the 2000s,"" he said. ""It used to be a fairly common occurrence where there would be literally hundreds of people sickened.""
Even so, the Trump administration has delayed some ""key"" portions of the food-safety overhaul from going into effect and is creating ""a gap"" in the farm-to-consumer ""safety chain,"" the Center for Science in the Public Interest charged Thursday.
The center also said the Trump administration is effectively ""undoing"" rules intended to protect consumers from being exposed to hazards such as E. coli or salmonella.

6892,Pluralsight spikes in debut on Nasdaq,"Shares of online learning company Pluralsight began trading on the Nasdaq at an opening price of $20 per share Thursday, roughly 34 percent above the $15 price at which Pluralsight priced shares in its initial public offering.
The arrival of Pluralsight on public markets suggests that public investors are still eager to invest in smaller technology companies.
Pluralsight first filed to go public on April 16. On May 7, the company said it estimated it would price shares between $10 and $12 each. And on May 15 Pluralsight upped the range to $12-14 per share. Finally, on May 16, the company announced the $15 pricing , coming in above the high end of the most recent range.
At that price, Pluralsight raised $310.5 million at an implied valuation of around $1.97 billion. Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan acted as the lead book-running managers in the deal.
While anyone can pay to take Pluralsight's courses online, the company focuses on education for many employees inside companies. In its filing to go public Pluralsight said competitors include Alphabet 's YouTube, Cornerstone OnDemand and Microsoft 's LinkedIn Learning.
Pluralsight offers more than 6,700 courses. At the end of the first quarter the company had 14,830 business customers, and at the end of last year it had more than 695,000 end users. In the first quarter 82 percent of Pluralsight's billings came from business customers.
""Technology is moving faster today than these companies can learn it so that creates a big skills gap around the world,"" CEO Aaron Skonnard told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" ahead of the opening trade. ""We make it possible for them to learn these skills quickly, keep up with that pace of change and thrive in the digital age.""
The company maintains an ""army of expert authors"" around the world to keep courses up to date and relevant, Skonnard said.
""That's what makes our value proposition unique,"" he said. ""No one else can move as quickly as us to provide that skilled training into the enterprise.""
The company's losses and revenue widened in the first quarter, with a $23.16 million loss on $49.64 million in revenue, compared with a $9.81 million loss on $37.24 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Around two-thirds of the company's revenue comes from within the U.S.
Pluralsight was founded in 2004 — Skonnard is one of its four founders — and is based in Farmington, Utah. The company had 890 employees on March 31. Investors include Insight Venture Partners, Iconiq Capital and former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.
Pluralsight is part of a collection of tech companies that have gone public in the past few months. Others include DocuSign , Dropbox , Smartsheet and Zuora .

6374,Market volatility is not over: Wall Street strategist,"Market volatility is not over: Wall Street strategist The underlying tone of the market is volatility, says strategist Nicholas Colas. ""The market is worried about a bunch of different factors, some of which are political and others are things like rates and energy prices,"" he says. Market watchers should expect more throughout the rest of the year, especially August and October, Colas says. 23 Hours Ago | 03:07
Thursday's roller-coaster ride on Wall Street was the market's attempt to assess risks, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of Datatrek Research.
""The underlying tone of the market is one toward volatility ,"" the Wall Street veteran told CNBC on Thursday.
""The market is worried about a bunch of different factors, some of which are political and others are things like rates and energy prices,"" Colas said on "" Closing Bell .""
But, he said, ""We haven't seen peak volatility for the year by any means.""
The market ended a four-day losing streak on Thursday after the Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from a loss of nearly 400 points midday. The index closed up 5.17 percent at 23,930. The S&P 500 closed 0.23 percent lower at 2,629.73, after falling as much as 1.6 percent in early-morning trading.
Market watchers should expect more volatility through the rest of 2018, especially in August and October when the market tends to peak, Colas said.
This week's trip to China by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other Trump administration officials, along with possible oil price increases, have added to investor fears.
But Colas said ""the stock market shouldn't care all that much. Until something affects consumer confidence or interest rates or global growth, it really shouldn't really matter to fundamentals.""
Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, said the economy is ""stronger than a garlic milkshake"" and the secular bull market should continue for several years. But, he said, he does think politics plays a role in how the market moves.
""I think the thing that affected the markets today is [that] Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow ... were getting the stiff-arm from China, and there was some worry about that,"" Saut said on ""Closing Bell."" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Playing",2018-05-04T01:39:00.000+03:00

1757,House budget chairman: Short-term deficit increases won't matter in a souped-up Trump economy,"Republicans on Capitol Hill want to be able to deliver on President Donald Trump 's newly proposed budget, which includes spending on infrastructure , defense and a border wall, House Budget Committee Chairman Steve Womack told CNBC on Tuesday.
But paying for those priorities, on top of the new GOP tax law, would likely add to the federal budget deficit, said Womack.
""While there are going to be some near-term deficit increases, we think the long-term health of the American economy is going to be much better as a result,"" the Arkansas Republican said on ""Squawk Box."" ""If we can achieve 3 percent growth, then we have achieved a great victory.""
The president's $4.4 trillion budget , unveiled Monday, includes federal spending of $200 billion for infrastructure upgrades; $18 billion for Trump's border wall; and $716 billion for national defense. The funding blueprint also calls for cutting $237 billion from Medicare ; rolling back Medicaid expansion; and gutting Obamacare .
Womack argued that a Republican willingness to add to budget deficits does not represent a shift in the party's message, which holds fiscal conservatism as a core principle.
""We're still the party that believes in a very strong national defense posture. National security is very important to a lot of us,"" he said. ""Building the nation's infrastructure is a key to helping jump-start an economy that's been in some anemic growth pattern for the past several years.""

4191,Oscar-nominee Timothée Chalamet's 1st big splurge: Knicks tickets,"Among the nominees for the 90th Academy Awards is Timothée Chalamet, star of ""Call Me By Your Name,"" the youngest person to earn a best actor nomination in nearly 80 years. And although Chalamet is quickly becoming one of the biggest names in Hollywood, he's still a normal 22-year-old in many ways, as he reveals to GQ's Daniel Riley in the magazine's March 2018 cover story .
When Chalamet earned his first major paycheck from a commercial he did for Disney in 2010, for instance, he chose to spend it on something fun. The actor immediately bought season tickets up in the nosebleed section for the New York Knicks, he tells Riley.
However, the actor ended up only attending a few games that season. When he purchased the tickets, he was convinced that free agent LeBron James would sign with the Knicks, but after the basketball star headed to Miami instead , Chalamet decided to sell off a bunch of his tickets.
Getty Images LeBron James of the Miami Heat drives around Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs in Game Five of the 2014 NBA Finals in San Antonio, Texas. Chalamet's splurge makes sense: As a native New Yorker, he's is a long-time Knicks super-fan, so he was opting to spend on experiences over things. The same year, just a few days before James announced his decision to go to Miami, Chalamet saw Amar'e Stoudemire, another player rumored to sign with the Knicks, tweet that he was in New York and attending a Broadway show.
TWEET 
Upon seeing the tweet, then-14-year-old Chalamet raced from his home in Hell's Kitchen to the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in Times Square, where he waited outside for two hours to catch a glimpse of Stoudemire, he told Vulture .
When the player finally exited, Chalamet asked him to sign a jersey. ""In fact, the first picture of Amar'e ever holding a New York jersey was in the Daily News , and there's a young me holding the jersey up to him to get him to sign it!"" he told Vulture.
During his interview with GQ, the actor also skipped a tour of his high school in favor of watching the Knicks warm up at Madison Square Garden.

5116,"EPA chief Scott Pruitt's $43,000 secure phone booth violated spending laws, government watchdog says","The Environmental Protection Agency violated federal laws by installing a $43,000 soundproof phone booth in the office of agency chief Scott Pruitt , a government watchdog said Monday.
The announcement from the Government Accountability Office comes as Pruitt is under fire for his use of taxpayer funds, renting an apartment tied to an energy lobbyist and allegedly retaliating against EPA staff for questioning his decisions.
The equipment in question, a secure communications booth that cost $43,238.68, was first reported last year and became an early symbol of EPA's high spending under Pruitt.
The GAO now said the purchase violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, which prohibits spending more than $5,000 to furnish or redecorate the office of a presidential appointee without approval from congressional appropriations committees.
""EPA was required to notify the appropriations committees of its proposed obligation. By failing to provide such advance notice, EPA violated section 710"" of the law, Thomas H. Armstrong, the GAO's general counsel wrote in a letter to lawmakers who requested the investigation.
The GAO also found the EPA violated the Antideficiency Act because it committed the funds ""in a manner specifically prohibited by law.""
show chapters The EPA whistleblower detailed allegations against Scott Pruitt in a pair of letters 5:47 PM ET Thu, 12 April 2018 | 00:46 The EPA did not immediately return CNBC's request for reaction to the GAO's finding.
Prior EPA administrators did not have similar setups, and Pruitt has access to secure communications equipment elsewhere at the agency's headquarters.
The agency had argued that the phone booth was a piece of functional equipment necessary for Pruitt to perform his job and was therefore not subject to rules regarding decorations or furnishings.
The GAO rejected that argument. Armstrong said the GAO's determination did not address whether the purchase was appropriate, but rather whether EPA followed the law when it approved it.
""We draw no conclusions regarding whether the installation of the privacy booth was the only, or the best, way for EPA to provide a secure telephone line for the Administrator,"" he said.
The determination marks a setback for the EPA and Pruitt, who is also being investigated by his agency's inspector general and Congress for running up hefty travel and security bills. The White House is also looking into Pruitt's rental of a condo owned by the wife of prominent energy lobbyist Steven Hart, whose firm had business before the EPA while the agency chief was living there.
Those and other controversies have raised speculation that Pruitt could be the next Trump deputy to part ways with an administration that has become notorious for its high turnover. However, President Donald Trump has recently defended Pruitt, who has spearheaded his push to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations.
@realDonald Trump: While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!

Reports first circulated last week that Iovine would leave his post in August, according to Billboard, citing unnamed sources.

2790,Amtrak blames freight train operator CSX for its deadly South Carolina crash,"A locked switch is being blamed for the collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a freight train that killed two people and injured more than 100 others in South Carolina early on Sunday.
The head of the National Transportation Safety Board said a switch on the tracks, which the freight hauler CSX owns and operates, was padlocked in a position that steered the Amtrak train onto a siding near Columbia, S.C., where it crashed into a parked, unoccupied CXS train.
""Key to this investigation is learning why the switch was lined that way,"" Robert Sumwalt, the chairman of the NTSB, told reporters at a news conference on Sunday. NTSB officials were not immediately available to elaborate.
Amtrak President and Chief Executive Richard Anderson told reporters Sunday that CSX was responsible for the wreck because of the locked switch. CSX officials were not available for comment.
Officials from both companies expressed condolences to the families of the two people killed, an Amtrak engineer and a conductor.
Two of the 116 people injured remained in critical condition overnight, officials said. Specifics were not available.
A team from the NTSB is expected to be on the scene for five to seven days. No probable cause will be issued at that time, the agency told media outlets.
Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Board, told a news conference the section of track was operated by CSX and there was a padlock on the switch that steered train traffic onto the siding.
""Key to this investigation is learning why the switch was lined that way,"" he said, calling the damage to the locomotives ""catastrophic."" An NTSB investigation team was at the site.
Amtrak engineer Michael Kempf, 54, of Savannah, Georgia, and conductor Michael Cella, 36, of Orange Park, Florida, were killed, Lexington County Coroner Margaret Fisher told reporters. Autopsies were being conducted, she said.
Two of the 116 people injured were in critical condition after the wreck, which occurred about 5 miles (8 km) southwest of the state capital, Columbia.
""It's a horrible thing to see, to understand what force was involved,"" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster told reporters. ""The first engine of the freight train was torn up, and the single engine of the passenger train is barely recognizable.""
Deadly crashes Anderson said the passenger train hit the tail end of the CSX train. That train had two locomotives and 34 empty auto racks used to transport cars, the NTSB said.
The passenger train's locomotive was left lying on its side, and the first car was bent and also derailed, although it remained upright, images from the scene showed.
At least four of the freight train's cars were crumpled, looking like crushed tinfoil, but remained on the tracks.
The passenger train was part of Amtrak's Silver Star Service. Officials said some 5,000 gallons of fuel leaked as a result of the collision but that there was no threat to public safety.
U.S. President Donald Trump received regular updates on the crash while at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. ""My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings (sic) train collision in South Carolina,"" he tweeted. ""Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they've done!""
Donald Trump tweet
McMaster said he had been told the Amtrak train was traveling at about 59 miles per hour (95 kph) on impact.
The NTSB did not release details on the speed at which the Amtrak train was traveling.
In December, three people were killed when an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Washington state. The engineer later told the NTSB he had misread a signal and tried to brake before the accident.
In late January, an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of the U.S. Congress killed one person in a garbage truck with which it collided in Virginia.
A Federal Railroad Administration Investigative team was also on the scene in South Carolina to help establish what happened.
""It is important to understand the factors that contributed to this tragic accident and how all stakeholders can ensure a safe and reliable rail system going forward,"" the U.S. Department of Transportation said in a statement.
A CSX spokesperson issued the following statement on the incident:
Our sincere condolences go out to the families of the two individuals who passed away following the tragic events that took place in Cayce, South Carolina early this morning. We remain focused on providing assistance and support to those impacted by today's incident. CSX hosts more passenger trains on its network than any other major railroad in the United States, and passenger rail remains one of the safest ways to travel. The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation into this incident and CSX will continue working with the investigating team.

863,"Trump administration plans to shield health staff refusing to do abortions, treat transgender people","The Trump administration reportedly is preparing to offer job protections for health-care workers who refuse to perform abortions or to treat transgender patients because of moral objections to doing so.
News of that proposed rule broke Tuesday night, hours before White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced that President Donald Trump on Friday will become the first sitting president ever to address the anti-abortion March for Life in Washington, D.C.
The proposed rule comes on the heels of the administration's attempts to block undocumented immigrant teenage girls in federal custody from obtaining abortions.
And the reported effort comes days after the Department of Health and Human Services either fired or accepted the resignation of a hard-line abortion opponent as head of HHS' family planning programs and replaced her with a leading skeptic of birth-control-promotion efforts. 
Politico first reported Tuesday on the administration's plans for a proposed rule that would ""shield health workers who refuse to perform abortions or treat transgender patients.""
The news site reported that the rule also seeks to ""punish organizations"" that do not permit their workers to express their moral objections to providing certain medical procedures or treating certain kinds of people.
The article noted that Roger Severino, who is head of HHS' office of civil rights, ""has a long record of advocating for religious groups and arguing against LGBT projections.""
""Severino also has been a strong critic of providing procedures to transgender patients seeking to transition,"" Politico's article said.
HHS, which did not respond to Politico's request for comment on the proposed rule, did not immediately respond to CNBC's own request for comment for this story.
The Democratic National Committee blasted the proposed rule Wednesday.
""Once again, women and the LGBTQ community are under attack from the Trump-Pence administration,"" said DNC director of women's media Elizabeth Renda and director of LGBT media Lucas Acosta in a prepared statement. ""Days before the anniversary of the Women's March, Republicans are giving health workers a license to discriminate against women and members of the LGBTQ community.""
""It wasn't enough to try to strip transgender Americans of their right to serve, roll back access to birth control, and attempt to defund Planned Parenthood,"" they wrote. ""Now Trump, Pence, and their Republican cronies want to allow health care workers to discriminate and rip away access to medical care. This rule is unethical and dangerously undermines public health.""
Dr. Ben Brown, an OB-GYN in Chicago and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said the proposed rule could have a negative effect on patients, by leading to unnecessary delays in urgent care needs.
""And that causes harm,"" Brown told CNBC. 
The doctor said that as a Quaker, he is sensitive to the moral concerns of his fellow health-care workers.
But Brown also said, ""I'm a doctor because I'm a Christian.""
""While it is absolutely important to respect the diversity of beliefs among providers, our basic job is to serve these patients and meet their basic needs,"" he said. ""Imposing one's beliefs on someone else is contrary to that value.""
""The important thing is that the patients get the care that they need.""
On Sunday, an undocumented teenage girl who had been in federal custody and whose desire for an abortion was being thwarted by HHS was released into the care of a sponsor.
The girl, known in court papers as ""Jane Moe,"" was the fourth pregnant undocumented teen publicly known to have sued HHS with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union over a new Trump administration policy that bars federal shelters from helping women in getting an abortion.
It is not known if Jane Moe has since obtained an abortion, but the other three girls have done so.",2018-01-17T20:22:00.000+02:00

I get more than people think, Trump says ""I get more exercise than people think,""Trump told Reuters on Wednesday He was open to changing his diet, perhaps with smaller portion sizes on White House meals Published 7 Hours Ago SHARES Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images US President Donald Trump waves after playing a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on November 5, 2017. 
Do not expect U.S. President Donald Trump to hit the gym, despite his doctor's orders. 
He gets plenty of exercise on the golf course and at the White House complex, the president told Reuters on Wednesday. 
""I get exercise. I mean I walk, I this, I that,"" Trump, 71, said during an Oval Office interview. ""I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think."" 
Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, said on Tuesday that Trump was in excellent health overall but needed to lose weight, eat better, and break a sweat more often. 
The fast-food-loving Trump praised Jackson, who has served as a physician to previous presidents, but seemed wary of taking the not-so-subtle suggestion to use the White House's exercise facilities. 
""A lot of people go to the gym and they'll work out for two hours and all. I've seen people ... then they get their new knees when they're 55 years old and they get their new hips and they do all those things. I don't have those problems,"" Trump said. 
He did say he was open to changing his diet, perhaps with smaller portion sizes on White House meals. 
Trump's predecessors, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W. Bush, were fitness enthusiasts, but Trump has no daily workout routine. He gets exercise by playing golf, he said, even though he typically rides around the course in a golf cart. 
Walking would leave him on the course longer than he prefers, he said. ""I don't want to spend the time."" 
Trump is considered overweight and borderline obese at 6 feet 3 inches (1.9 meters) tall and 239 pounds (108 kg). 
""Most of us could lose a couple of pounds,"" he said, before scanning the Reuters reporters in the room and pronouncing them in ""pretty good shape."" 
As for his mental acuity, Trump was quick to note his doctor's pronouncement that he aced a cognitive exam, which he referenced with a dig at predecessors Obama, Bush and Bill Clinton for not doing more to curb threats from North Korea. 
""I guess they all realized they're going to have to leave it to a president that scored the highest on tests. What can I tell you?"" he said. 
Regarding his physical health, he said he had dieted successfully before. 
""I've always been more of a believer in diet 'cause I'm strong, you know? I hit the ball far. I mean, I'm strong, physically,"" he said. 
""The people that do the food at the White House are extraordinary, but I think they can maybe make the portions a little bit smaller and maybe we'll cut out some of the more fattening ingredients,"" he said. ""And I'm OK with that.""",2018-01-18T04:12:00.000+02:00

5134,FOCUS-GM banks on low-cost vehicles in Brazil as auto sales rise,"FOCUS-GM banks on low-cost vehicles in Brazil as auto sales rise Nick Carey and Brad Haynes Published 23 Hours Ago Reuters
DETROIT/SAO PAULO, April 25 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is planning for long-term profitability in South America built on the back of draconian cost cutting during Brazil's recession and the same low-cost vehicles it is developing for Chinese consumers, which are due to hit dealerships in 2019.
""We have been refreshing the vehicle family (in South America), building up market share and getting the cost point right, all in preparation for one vehicle family,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in a recent interview.
That 'one family' will consist of an expected 2 million units made annually for South America and China that will lower production costs.
""That is an unprecedented level of scale,"" Ammann said.
GM is doubling down in South America, where it is already the top-selling automaker, thanks largely to two Chevrolet models, the subcompact Onix and the Prisma sedan. It expects better margins from rising sales and new lower-cost production models, including SUVs and crossovers increasingly favored by consumers.
The automaker's plan, which GM has not previously disclosed, is part of an overarching strategy focused on profitability instead of trying to compete in every market.
The U.S. automaker has pulled out of unprofitable operations in Europe and countries such as India.
But GM is still betting on Brazil, a country just starting to come out of its deepest recession in decades. Carlos Zarlenga, head of the automaker's operations in Brazil and Argentina, recalls that during the downturn executives scrutinized every purchase request over $10,000.
GM cut its Brazilian labor force 35 percent, persuaded unions to agree to multi-year contracts with wages pegged to inflation, reworked its supply chain and ditched a slick Sao Paulo building for offices at a nearly 90-year-old auto plant.
""The whole purpose was to make sure we maximized every inch of expenditure,"" Zarlenga told Reuters in a recent interview.
Ammann says the cost reductions lowered GM's breakeven point in Brazil by 40 percent.
After hitting a record of 3.80 million units in 2012, auto sales in Brazil - the world's eighth largest market, accounting for a majority of South American sales - plunged 46 percent to 2.05 million in 2016.
The economy began to gradually rebound in 2017, lifting auto sales by 9 percent. GM's South American operations posted a profit of $100 million in 2017, the first since 2013.
""South America can become a meaningful contributor"" to GM's overall profits, Ammann said.
GM also passed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV last year to become Brazil's top-selling automaker for the first time since 2004, according to data from industry group Anfavea.
Brazil auto sales rose 16 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, Anfavea reported. GM expects 2018 industry sales will hit 2.4 million units.
Rival Toyota Motor Corp has also invested in new plants in Brazil and is working to become more competitive in South America.
In January, U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co hinted at possible significant changes for its money-losing South American business.
""DIFFERENT FOUNDATION""
Last year, GM halted car sales in India - where it had less than one percent market share - and pulled out of parts of Africa to focus on profitable operations.
In 2017 it sold Opel, its struggling European arm, to France's Peugeot SA.
In an April 20 client note, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said GM could ""follow a similar path"" in South America.
""The precedent of GM exiting a region with little or no chance to generate positive returns for shareholders has been set,"" Jonas wrote.
But exiting other markets has freed up capital for GM. In August, it said it plans to invest $1.4 billion at three plants in Brazil.
GM was in a better starting position in South America than in markets like India, said Ammann.
""That's a foundation that's different than some of the other markets in the world where we've decided we don't see a path to long-term success,"" Ammann said.
He said South American consumers tend to like similar vehicles to their counterparts in China, where the automaker is developing a new family of cheaper vehicles with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd.
Some of those vehicles will join GM's South American lineup in 2019.
""We can get a level of scale that we couldn't in Europe,"" said Ammann.
Lower production costs mean GM can add features - safety, infotainment and connectivity - normally standard in more expensive models, he added.
Guido Vildozo, IHS Markit's senior manager for the Americas, cautioned that South American drivers have decades more driving experience than Chinese consumers and higher expectations.
""There is always a risk when you develop a vehicle for China where driving dynamics are not such a high priority and sell it in a market where they are priority,"" Vildozo said. ""A lot will depend on how these vehicles evolve.""

Published 17 Hours Ago Reuters Lai Seng Sin | Reuters Mahathir Mohamad, former Malaysian prime minister and opposition candidate for Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) reacts during a news conference after general election, in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, May 9, 2018.
Malaysia said it will introduce a sales and service tax (SST) to partly offset the shortfall in revenue from effectively scrapping a goods and service tax (GST) from June.
The Mahathir Mohamad -led government, which won last week's general election, said on Wednesday it would lower GST to zero percent from June 1. Ousted leader Najib Razak had introduced the tax in 2015 amid lower oil prices.
In a statement on Thursday, the ministry of finance said the shortfall in revenue will be supported by specific revenue and expenditure measures that will be announced soon, including the reintroduction of the sales and services tax.
""Fiscal reform is being implemented. Expenditure reduction will begin with rationalisation and efficiency measures and reducing leakages,"" the statement said.
It did not say when the sales tax will be introduced.
Brian Tan, a Singapore-based economist with Nomura, said the timing of SST implementation was a concern.
""It is a question of how quickly you can bring (the SST)back. In the intervening period of the removal of GST and the return of SST, there is obviously going to be a gap in revenue. The question is how long and large will that gap be,"" he said.
The finance ministry statement also added that rising oil prices will provide short-term fiscal space.
""No doubt (the higher oil price) is helpful but the problem is that it may not be enough. It is important that they bring in the SST soon,"" Tan said.",2018-05-17T05:45:00.000+03:00

When the recession hit in 2008 and even jobs waiting tables between gigs were hard to come by, reality set in. So he took his prized possession — an old 1969 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top guitar he had bought for $1300 — and listed it on eBay.
It sold for $2500.
""That was a revelation to me because I didn't have that kind of scratch around,"" he tells CNBC Make It , reflecting on the $1200 profit. ""I liked the taste of that, so I did that more and more.""
CNBC | Zack Guzman Henry Brown tunes a guitar in his Portland music studio. It's where he stores the bulk of his inventory that's listed online. What started as just a quick way to raise some much needed cash has now blossomed into a business that nets Brown over $150,000 a year. He works a total of just five hours a day, scouting and selling instruments and other gear, yet his vintage e-commerce store , The Bonfires Vintage, brings in over $500,000 in annual sales. His success has allowed him to open his own 1,000-square-foot recording studio in Portland, Oregon, where he now lives. He plays, uses and records with the equipment he buys before flipping it.
In a way, being his own boss and running his own music operation has become a new dream for Brown. As he describes it, he gets paid to play with some of the nicest vintage instruments, all on his own schedule.
""That kind of control of your economic destiny is very empowering,"" the 36-year-old says. He does admit, though, in the beginning, it was also fairly terrifying. ""Restaurants were closing every day. Everyone was out of work,"" he explains. 
Luckily for Brown, he was able to give up waiting tables when he realized he was making more money occasionally selling equipment online.
Henry Brown | In his 20s, Henry Brown juggled playing in a band, waiting tables and flipping guitars before the latter won out. ""I just decided to hang it up and do my own thing and make my own economy if the if the broader economy wasn't working for me,"" he says.
Things accelerated when he shifted from buying offline and selling online to doing both through Reverb, an online marketplace dedicated to used and new musical equipment, in 2013. Sales quadrupled when Brown was able to more easily find the perfect products to flip.
""I learned that, due to my experience being a musician for so many years, I had accumulated this sort of nerd storehouse of information about instruments, and that I knew something that somebody didn't,"" he laughs. ""What I'm essentially monetizing in my business is my knowledge.""
Brown scoops up vintage amps, guitars, pedals, drums and other equipment, which he can fix if necessary, and then sells it for a profit. After receiving the gear, he takes a few photos and writes a description for the site. Once someone purchases a piece, all he has to do is ship it. To maximize his efforts, Brown focuses on gear he believes he can flip for at least twice as much as he paid.
In his most successful deal so far, Brown bought a 1958 vintage Sony tube condenser microphone for $1,200 and sold it for nearly $5,000. With a single sale, he pocketed more money than he would have made in a month waiting tables. 
But it's not all about the money.
Reverb | Henry Brown The 1958 Sony C-37A vintage tube condenser microphone may be old, but it fetches a pretty penny. ""Certainly the best part of being involved in e-commerce is the flexibility,"" Brown says, adding that he's able to spend more time at home with his family. ""I make my own hours to a certain extent I make my own salary depending on how much I wish to work and I'm my own boss.""
And as a musician who started with dreams of making music, it doesn't hurt that Brown essentially pays himself to find a reason to play with some of the gear he'd most likely be buying anyway.
""It has enabled me to stay in music and that's what's been really important to me,"" he says.

6910,Suzy Welch: Here's a clever little secret to managing your manager,"A bad boss can have a huge impact on your happiness and productivity at work — so much so that you may be tempted to voice your dissatisfaction.
But regardless of how eager you are to address the issue, bestselling management author and CNBC contributor Suzy Welch says you'll want to think twice before offering your critiques. Welch says that even if your boss gives you an opening, like asking, ""Do you have any feedback for me?"" you'll want to refrain from sharing your totally honest opinion.
""Giving your boss negative feedback almost always backfires,"" she tells CNBC Make It . ""My advice — don't even try it. It's too hard to finesse a tough message like 'You micromanage me.'""
CNBC Contributor Suzy Welch Instead, Welch says you should use this simple hack to ""manage up.""
""If your boss asks for feedback, instead of criticism, offer praise — high praise,"" she says.
Rather than focusing on the problematic aspects of your boss's behavior, Welch says you'll want to point out an instance where their actions didn't drive you crazy. For example, if your boss tends to be vague about details when giving assignments, thank them for the one time they did provide clear expectations.
""Effuse about how much you appreciated that clarity and how it helped you do your job better,"" she says. ""Go overboard with gratitude for the transparent communication on that occasion.""
Welch emphasizes that this approach is clever without being dishonest. ""Let's just call it 'shrewd,'"" she says.
Learning how to manage your manager isn't easy, but according to Welch, it can be very beneficial to your career.
""This technique is the only one I know that allows you to give feedback without blowback,"" she says. ""Give it a try.""
Suzy Welch is the co-founder of the Jack Welch Management Institute and a noted business journalist, TV commentator and public speaker.

502,Wyndham Worldwide to buy La Quinta's hotel business for $1.95 billion,"U.S. hotel operator Wyndham Worldwide said on Thursday it would acquire La Quinta's hotel operations for $1.95 billion, it said on Thursday, adding another well-known U.S. brand and nearly 900 mid-scale, upper mid-scale and economy locations to its portfolio.
Wyndham Hotel Group, known for its own-brand hotels as well as Ramada, Days Inn and Super 8 budget lodgings, will now have a total of 21 brands when the La Quinta deal closes in the second quarter of 2018.
Shares of La Quinta rose 8.4 percent on the news while those of Wyndham rose 2.5 percent in premarket trade.
Moodys Lodging analyst Peter Trombetta said the deal would be ""credit-positive"" for Wyndham by giving it more exposure to a segment where revenue per available room (RevPAR) — a key industry metric — was outperforming other businesses.
""(It) adds a well-performing brand to Wyndham's midscale and upper midscale hotel portfolio two segments that have been growing RevPAR faster than any other segment outside of the economy segment,"" he said.
Last year, Wyndham Worldwide said it would spin off its business into two separate, publicly traded companies - Wyndham Hotel Group and Wyndham Vacation Ownership.
The planned spin-off of Wyndham Hotel Group remains on track for the second quarter of 2018, the company said on Thursday.
La Quinta shareholders will receive $8.40 per share in cash and Wyndham will repay about $715 million of La Quinta debt net of cash.
Ahead of the sale, La Quinta will also spin off its real estate assets into a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, CorePoint Lodging Inc.
Wyndham said it would set aside a reserve of $240 million for estimated taxes as part of La Quinta's spin-off of its real estate assets.
La Quinta had a market capitalization of about $2.28 billion as of Wednesday's close.
If the deal falls through, La Quinta will pay Wyndham a termination fee of $37 million.

1028,Another firm just pulled its plans to launch bitcoin ETFs,"4 Hours Ago | 04:46 
Another firm has withdrawn plans to offer exchange-traded funds that would track the wildly popular cryptocurrency bitcoin. 
In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, ProShares said it would like to pull its application for four ETFs that would have been tied to bitcoin trading on the futures market. 
No reason was given for the move, and a ProShares representative said the company would have no comment. 
ProShares announced its intention in September to launch the bitcoin funds ahead of the CBOE and CME plans to trade futures for the digital currency on the open market. Industry watchers had figured that the futures trading would provide the key impetus for regulators to approve bitcoin ETFs, as it would set a concrete price level for valuing the funds. 
But that has not proven to be the case as regulators continue to push back on bitcoin ETF plans. 
On Monday, trusts controlled by Rafferty Asset Management and Exchange Traded Concepts both said they were canceling three bitcoin-related funds. A filing for one of the funds indicated that SEC staff had ""expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation"" of the futures contracts. 
In its letter, ProShares merely said its move ""is being made in response to a request from the Staff."" The firm had proposed funds that would have allowed investors to bet both for and against bitcoin. ETFs trade like stocks and would give retail investors another avenue to get in on the burgeoning digital currency trade, in which bitcoin's price has exploded more than 1,500 percent higher over the past year. 
ProShares is the 10th-largest provider of ETFs, with $29.5 billion under management in the $3.5 trillion industry. 
The withdrawals came just days after Direxion Asset Management proposed a set of ETFs that would use leverage to allow investors to capture multiples of the bitcoin futures' performance. The funds would deliver 1, 1.25, 1.5 and 2 times the return, either higher or lower. One strategist called the proposal ""insane"" and another said it was ""eye-watering."" 
Direxion has just shy of $13 billion worth of ETFs under management. The firm declined comment on its plans.",2018-01-09T21:33:00.000+02:00
3840,"Tesla’s up 10% from the February lows, and it could bounce even higher","Trader Todd Gordon has set his sights on Tesla for a big bounce, particularly given how the stock has performed despite a volatile market.
""There are a few stocks that have shown very good relative strength in that period of volatility,"" Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""One of which is Tesla."" As of Tuesday's close, Tesla shares have rallied more than 10 percent since the market bottomed on Feb. 9.
Along with the stock's resilience, Gordon also sees that Tesla has yet to go through what is known as the fifth wave in the Elliott Wave theory. The theory posits that stocks go through waves of rallies and corrections, and Gordon believes that since the stock has recently consolidated for a second ""wave"" down, the only way for Tesla to go is up.
To find the exact levels at which the TradingAnalysis.com founder wants to trade Tesla, he draws a parallel channel connecting a stocks' highs and lows. Tesla's chart, according to Gordon, shows the stock bouncing up every time it hits the bottom line, which convinces Gordon that Tesla could actually retest the bottom support line, at which he'd encourage investors to buy the stock.
Gordon wants to sell the April monthly 315-strike put and pair that with the purchase of the April monthly 310-strike put for a net credit of about $1.55. That means if Tesla were to remain above $315 on April 20 expiration, Gordon would collect the $155 credit he received making the trade.
But Gordon could lose up to $342 if Tesla sinks below $310 on the expiration date. As a result, Gordon wants to establish a point at which to step out of the trade.
""If we start to come back to the $295 mark, then it's showing that there's weakness in this chart and it looks like this channel might ultimately fail,"" he said. ""Otherwise, it looks like the upside is in plan.""
Tesla closed at $328.20 on Tuesday and was trading at $323.95 on Wednesday morning.

2690,Apple said it wants to become 'cash neutral' - which could be a huge boost for earnings,"Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, did say earlier this month that the company was ""targeting to become approximately net cash netural over time."" 
Milunovich explains a couple of different ways Apple could do that. 
One option is for the company to repurchase 10 percent of its shares each year until 2021, boosting earnings per share 30 percent from estimates. Another scenario is for Apple to spend between $30 billion and $60 billion per year on share repurchases and combine that with a dividend yield of 3 percent until 2023 — which he says is what Wall Street is currently leaning toward. 
Some investors have speculated that Apple might buy a big U.S. company with its new free-flowing capital, but Milunovich said: ""Don't hold your breath."" 
""On the M&A front we expect Apple to continue its strategy of filling technology or personnel gaps with small tuck-in acquisitions. Transformational M&A would result in a collision of different cultures and priorities, which Apple has thus far avoided,"" he wrote. 
Dividend increases are not always a great sign for technology companies: ""A juicy yield can mask a company's shaky fundamentals, at least temporarily,"" as one Barron's reporter put it. Reuters points to Hewlett-Packard in the early 2000s as an example of buybacks that ""cannibalize innovation"" and ""slow growth."" 
But in this case, Milunovich said he doesn't see the capital structure weighing on Apple's valuation — he said investors are still watching Apple's ability to grow and turn capital into profits .

5581,Republican John Kasich met privately with billionaire Ron Burkle as he considers 2020 run for president,"Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich , who is considering another run for president in 2020, recently met privately with billionaire investor and philanthropist Ron Burkle, who has a reputation for donating to candidates and causes across the political spectrum, CNBC has learned.
Kasich met with Burkle in March in Los Angeles, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Kasich, who has been crisscrossing the country, was asked to host a speaking event at Burkle's home. The billionaire co-founder of investment firm Yucaipa Companies did not attend the event, the sources said.
The event at Burkle's mansion was not a fundraiser, and Kasich focused his speech, as well as a question-and-answer session, on leadership values and police reforms, according to people who attended the talk.
It is unclear whether Kasich, who is in his second term as Ohio's governor, discussed a potential 2020 run with Burkle during their meeting on the sidelines. Term limits prevent Kasich from running for a third term.
show chapters John Kasich's allies are reaching out to GOP mega donors 5:59 PM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 | 01:02 The meeting took place at a time when Kasich deliberates whether he should run for president in two years. His friends and associates have been meeting with megadonors to gauge their interest in backing him for another go at the White House, sources previously told CNBC.
According to the sources, donors have told Kasich's top political lieutenants that they would support a Kasich presidential campaign against President Donald Trump — depending on whether Republicans can hold congressional majorities this fall and how close federal investigations get to Trump. It was not clear which donors Kasich's allies talked to.
During his March stop in Los Angeles, Kasich declined to rule out a run in 2020. ""All of my options are on the table,"" he said, according to Politico .
Kasich ran for president in 2016. He won only his home state of Ohio, while Trump systematically stacked up wins and delegates on his way to the nomination.
A spokesman for Kasich did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for Burkle declined to comment.
Burkle's political history Burkle, who also owns a part of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins franchise, has a history of contributing to candidates on both sides of the political divide — including a hefty donation to a pro-Kasich super PAC.
In the 2008 election cycle, he gave thousands of dollars to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during their battle for president, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Burkle was also a longtime supporter of President Bill Clinton .
show chapters Gov. John Kasich slams Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs 12:47 PM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 02:23 In 2016, he gave $15,400 to California Democrat Kamala Harris' joint fundraising committee, the Kamala Harris Victory Fund, during her first run for Senate and $5,400 directly to her campaign committee. During that same cycle, he gave $100,000 to New Day for America, a pro-Kasich super PAC, and hosted a fundraiser for the Republican.
Throughout 2017, Burkle directed most of his political contributions toward the cause of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The billionaire gave $100,000 to the McCarthy Victory Fund and $89,600 to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the fundraising arm for House Republicans seeking re-election.
Burkle did not make any contributions during the first quarter this year, according to federal filings.
Weighing Trump's vulnerability Friends of Kasich say it's unclear what he will eventually decide about running for president, particularly if he would have to face Trump in a primary.
""Something would have to happen to greatly wound Trump to get that hardcore base away from him,"" Charlie Black, a former advisor to Kasich's 2016 campaign, told CNBC. ""If the primary polling numbers continue to be where they roughly are now, nobody would run against [Trump] because it would be suicide.""
If he does decide to run, he will need a big infusion of cash — which is where donors such as Burkle could come in.
While Kasich had a formidable fundraising operation, his 2016 presidential campaign committee ended up with $176,000 on hand, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. His campaign raised $18 million, while the pro-Kasich super PAC, New Day for America, brought in $15 million.
The PAC is still active and has $281,000 on hand, according to financial disclosure reports. Even though the group hasn't received many contributions this year, it brought in donations as lucrative as $100,000 in 2017.",2018-04-26T07:00:00.000+03:00

The firm believes discount stores will thrive over the next five to ten years. CNBC.com Brendan McDermid | Reuters A man pushes a cart load of goods after shopping at a Target store during Black Friday shopping in Brooklyn, New York, November 24, 2017.
Target shares will rise as the discount retailer benefits from aging demographics, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The firm reiterated its buy rating for the retailer and added the stock to its US1 top ideas list.
""We believe the company should benefit from the discount store cycle … given our view that TGT's efforts to turn around its US business should accelerate in 2018 and result in market share gains longer-term,"" analyst Robert Ohmes said in a note to clients Wednesday. ""The Discount Store cycle that we expect to play out over the next 5-10 years [is] supported by … demographics as aging Millennials and Baby Boomers support growth of budget conscious consumers.""
Target shares rose 2 percent Wednesday after the report. Its shares are up 9.9 percent through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 0.6 percent gain.
Ohmes reiterated his $86 price target for Target shares, representing 20 percent upside to Tuesday's close.
The analyst noted the stock trades at only 13 times his fiscal 2020 earnings per share estimate and has a 3.2 percent dividend yield. He also cites Target's strong free cash flow yield of 6 percent.

5056,"John Kasich's allies are reaching out to GOP mega donors, seeing if they’d back him in a run against Trump","Getty Images Ohio Governor John Kasich (R-OH) 
Close allies of John Kasich have reached out to prominent GOP donors to gauge their interest in backing the Republican Ohio governor against President Donald Trump in a possible 2020 showdown, CNBC has learned. 
Kasich has not decided whether he will run for president in 2020, but Republican mega donors have indicated to his top political lieutenants that they are willing to back him over Trump under certain circumstances, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told CNBC under the condition of anonymity. 
In private discussions with Kasich's top political lieutenants, GOP mega donors have said they would support a Kasich presidential campaign depending on whether Republicans can hold congressional majorities this fall and how close federal investigations get to Trump, the sources said. 
A political spokesman for Kasich declined to comment. 
According to the sources, the same Kasich allies who have met with some of the most influential donors in the country have suggested to the governor that there are two scenarios in which he should challenge Trump in a primary. 
First, would come after a potential 2018 congressional midterm wave that gives Democrats majorities in the House and the Senate. With that, Republican voters could potentially move toward a candidate like Kasich, who is considered more of a centrist in the GOP. Such a loss in the midterms could also signal to GOP donors that there's a need for drastic change at the top. 
Trump's approval rating stands at just lower than 42 percent, according to a polling average calculated by nonpartisan website Real Clear Politics . 
The other scenario pitched to Kasich would ride on the political implications of the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. The probe is looking into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice in the investigation. 
If the investigation makes its way into the Oval Office, Kasich's friends have said, it may be an opportunity for the governor to run as either a Republican or an independent. 
This latest development comes as buzz continues to build around another potential Kasich run for the White House. In March, he said ""all of my options are on the table"" for 2020, according to Politico . 
The Ohio governor is also hitting states that are critical to winning presidential primaries. During his visit to New Hampshire earlier this month, he said in an interview with The New York Times that he considers himself a ""hybrid"" Republican and more people are approaching him since his loss in 2016. 
""I have people of all shapes, sizes, philosophies and party preferences that approach me. But what does that mean? I don't know. I'm on television, so all the sudden they want to talk to me. Television moves everybody up, right?"" he told the Times. 
Charlie Black, a former advisor to Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign, told CNBC that he thinks the scenarios are part of an ongoing discussion and warned that his old boss would not stand a chance against Trump in a primary within the current political climate. 
""Trump presently has about an 85 percent job approval among primary voters. Unless that dropped dramatically, no one can compete with him for the nomination,"" Black said. ""He would have to be under 50 before I would advise anyone to run."" Kasich and the cash game 
For donors, a blue wave in the upcoming elections could be a sign that the leadership of the GOP has to change starting at the top – particularly after investing millions of dollars in an electoral effort that many political strategists say could be a wash for Republicans. 
The House is where the GOP is running into the biggest hurdles, with incumbents struggling to raise money and their districts turning in the favor of Democrats. 
The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks elections, came out with a new study on Tuesday showing Democrats outraising Republicans in the first quarter of the year. The findings led the group to change ratings in seven GOP districts to more favorable status for Democrats. 
""In the most recent fundraising period, Democrats outraised Republicans in at least 60 GOP-held seats, more than twice the 23 seats Democrats need for a majority. Meanwhile, the reverse is true in just five Democratic-held seats,"" the report said. 
If Kasich, who won only his home state during the 2016 GOP primaries, chooses to run in 2020, he's going to need the cash that he struggled to cobble together the last time he ran for president. 
While he ran a formidable fundraising operation, Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign committee ended up with $176,000 on hand, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. At the same time, his campaign raised $18 million, while the pro Kasich super PAC, New Day for America, brought in $15 million. 
The PAC is still active and has $281,000 on hand, according to financial disclosure reports. Even though the group hasn't received many contributions this year, it raked in donations that went up to $100,000 in 2017.

1570,January and its unusual string of new highs is setting a good tone for the market,"As Januarys go, this one is looking to be particularly good for stocks.
Not since 1964 has the S&P 500 started the year with six record highs, and for the Nasdaq, it's been since 1999, according to LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. The S&P was up 13 percent in 1964, but the Nasdaq roared ahead 85 percent in 1999, before crashing shortly after.
The fact that the first five trading days of the year were positive was already a good omen. Detrick, senior market strategist, said when the first five days of a new year are up 2 percent or more, the full year has been higher 15 out of 15 times. The average gain in those years has been 18.6 percent.
""It sure seems like there's something to it,"" said Detrick. ""Even though it's a very small sample size it does suggest if you get the ball rolling it can very well continue. The fact it was such a strong start to the year just continues to reinforce the bull market is still alive and there's probably a lot more positives than negatives as we move out into 2018.""
Detrick said January looks to be sizing up to a positive month overall, and as the Wall Street saying goes, ""So goes January, so goes the year.""
""Off to a good start and January is higher is just one more sign this could be a double-digit equity return year for investors,"" he said.
But a good January doesn't mean a good February, and Detrick said there could be a pullback in February, one of the weaker months, before the market moves higher in March and April, seasonally strong months.
Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said it's possible there could be a pullback even before next month. On Tuesday he released his S&P 500 year-end target of 3,000. The S&P closed Tuesday at 2,741, up 0.1 percent but up nearly 3 percent for the year so far.
""If it happens, January is a likely time for it,"" he said. ""I think it could happen later this month as you get closer to the government funding deadline of the 19th and a little later the [Federal Open Market Committee]. Not that the FOMC is going to be a catalyst in general, but there's a rich history of leadership transitions being a source of more volatility.""
The Fed meeting Jan. 30-31 is the last to be chaired by Janet Yellen before she hands over the reins to Jerome Powell. The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates at that meeting.
Emanuel said there was medium-term market volatility in past transitions of Fed chairs. ""[Ben] Bernanke took over in 2006. Obviously, the top came in 2007. [Alan] Greenspan on the other hand, took over in the summer of 1987, and literally you had the market crash within months of him taking over,"" he said.
Emanuel said when Paul Volcker came in during the late 1970s, there was a massive surge in gold and interest rates.
Interest rates could be a factor for markets Wednesday, after the 10-year broke 2.50 and hit a high of 2.55 percent Tuesday, its highest since March. The move in yields started with a move by the Bank of Japan to buy fewer bonds , which stirred speculation it was moving away from quantitative easing.
But strategists believe the move was more technical and the BOJ will continue its easy policies, at least for now.
The Treasury auctions $20 billion reopened 10-year notes at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday.
""I'm expecting average results. I don't think the dip buyers are going to come in just yet. We've got to see the data at the end of the week,"" said George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Nomura. CPI is reported Friday, and the markets have been awaiting inflation news.
""We broke through the 2.50 level [on the 10-year]. It's a psychological level. I don't think it's going to be a stellar auction,"" he said.

2773,Nvidia's massive run reminds me of the tech bubble,"Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent years, soaring triple digits in the last 12 months alone.
However, a breather is long overdue.
Consider these astronomical gains as the company is set to report quarterly earnings next week. After an 850 percent rally from its February 2016 lows and a 1,150 percent in the last three years, long-term investors may want to consider taking some small profits in the stock.
Reminiscent of the dot-com bubble? The stock's rally has been so strong over such a short period of time that it is now trading at a premium of more than 250 percent to its 200-day moving average; this is extreme, and reminiscent of what we saw for several tech stocks near the top of the tech bubble. Remember, Apple had a near-identical premium at the market top in 2000.
Indeed, it is difficult to time the market. Still, there is a difference between attempting to ""time the market"" and ""managing your investments in a responsible way.""
Positioning your portfolio We can think of Nvidia's rise in another way. If you bought Nvidia two years ago, you can sell just 11 percent of your investment and get back 100 percent of what you put into the stock, but you'll still be able to take advantage of almost 90 percent of any further upside movement!
Investors do not have to sell all at once, particularly when they have fabulous gains.
They don't have to try to wring every last penny of profit out of the investment; peeling off small amounts after moves like these is simply a prudent way to manage one's investments properly ... and feel a lot better when the stock sees an inevitable correction.

5991,Warren Buffett: Wells Fargo was slow to stop bad behavior but it's a good business,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday that Wells Fargo was slow to stop bad behavior in its ranks, but it's an overall good business.
""They made one mistake,"" Buffett said in a "" Squawk Box "" interview. ""Incentives work. And they came up with improper incentives and they worked. And so, they [incentivized] bad behavior instead of [incentivizing] good behavior. And that happens from time to time.""
Wells Fargo's stock was up 1 percent in premarket trading.
Wells admitted that as many as 3.5 million accounts were created for customers without their permission. That's nearly 70 percent more than originally thought. The scandal led to the departure of multiple executives, including former CEO John Stumpf.
The bank said Friday that it settled a class action securities fraud lawsuit for $480 million. Wells denied claims in the suit and that it settled to avoid further cost and disruption.

2731,Trump threatens to yank immigration enforcement from California,"CNBC.com Leah Millis | Reuters President Donald Trump talks about gun safety in schools during a meeting with local and state officials about improving school safety at the White House in Washington, February 22, 2018. 
President Donald Trump angrily said Thursday that he is considering withdrawing immigration and border control enforcement agencies from California because of what he called the state's ""protection of horrible criminals."" 
Trump said crime would explode in California if he took such an action — and predicted that the Golden State would be ""begging"" for the return of federal immigration authorities within two months. 
CNBC has reached out to the office of California Gov. Jerry Brown for comment on Trump's threats. In his state of the state address late last month, Brown issued a strong rebuke to Trump's previous threats over how California deals with immigration. 
""Let me be clear,"" Brown said at the time. ""We will defend everybody — every man, woman and child who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state."" 
In January, California became the nation's first ""sanctuary state,"" which restricts to what degree state and local authorities, as well as employers, can cooperate with federal immigration agencies. 
Trump lashed out against California during remarks he made Thursday during a White House event on school safety. His tirade began as he spoke about gang members such as those in the Salvadoran group MS-13. 
""These are absolutely animals, these aren't human beings, these are animals,"" Trump said. 
He said that ""while we're getting MS-13 out by the thousands,"" members of the gang still manage to enter the United States. 
""They're smart,"" Trump said. ""They actually have franchises going to Los Angeles."" 
""We're getting no help from the state of California,"" the president fumed, saying that the state is doing a lousy job of managing the situation, despite having ""the highest taxes in the nation."" 
""Frankly, if I wanted to pull our people from California, you'd have a crime mess like you've never seen in California,"" Trump said. ""All I'd have to say is ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol, let California alone, you'd be inundated, you would see crime like nobody's seen in this country."" 
""Frankly, it's a disgrace,"" Trump said. ""The sanctuary city situation, the protection of these horrible criminals ... if we ever pulled our ICE out and said, 'Hey, let California alone and let them figure it out themselves,' in two months they'd be begging for us to come back."" 
""And you know what? I'm thinking about doing it!"" 
The action followed raids in Northern California targeting undocumented immigrant workers.

6242,UPDATE 2-Embraer breakup complications are delaying its deal with Boeing -sources,"UPDATE 2-Embraer breakup complications are delaying its deal with Boeing -sources Tatiana Bautzer and Brad Haynes Published 6:17 PM ET Thu, 10 May 2018 Reuters
-sources@ (Adds comments from Boeing CEO, closing share price)
SAO PAULO, May 10 (Reuters) - The tricky work of divvying up the three business segments of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA has been delaying an agreement to combine operations with Boeing Co, three people with knowledge of the matter said this week.
The two planemakers announced last month that they were in talks to set up a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense division and possibly its business jet unit.
The companies have won the support of Brazil's government for such a deal, but the maneuver has created other headaches, according to the sources, who spoke to Reuters anonymously due to the sensitivity of talks.
Negotiators are picking through the details of long-term service contracts between the companies and working on how to distribute Embraer's thousands of engineers, many of whom have migrated between military and civilian projects during their careers.
Asked for comment, Boeing referred to remarks by Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg on Wednesday, when he said talks were making progress, but the Embraer deal was not a ""must do.""
Embraer representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
Embraer shares in Sao Paulo erased gains after the Reuters report, closing 2.6 percent lower on Thursday.
The decision to leave Embraer's defense operations separated has helped to overcome concerns about sovereign control of Embraer's military programs by the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto over the deal, but it has not produced a final agreement as quickly as some expected.
""I'm quite optimistic,"" said Defense Minister Joaquim Silva e Luna, who is responsible for the task force overseeing the deal, when asked about the negotiation. ""It is in advanced stages and should be resolved this year.""
Boeing's original proposal, a straightforward acquisition, could have been wrapped up by now, but it has proven more challenging to design an offer that leaves Embraer standing as a financially robust company focused on defense, the sources said.
Embraer's 70- to 130-seat E-Jets, which compete with the C-Series program designed by Bombardier Inc and run by Airbus SE, account for about 60 percent of the Brazilian firm's revenue and nearly all of its operating profit.
The company's defense division has barely turned a profit in recent years, since Brazil's government slashed military spending in an effort to close a gaping budget deficit.
Embraer has also been losing money on a fresh line-up of business jets, as the executive aviation market stagnates.
The companies have still not reached a final decision on whether to include the unit with the commercial jet division in the new company, in which Boeing would own a roughly 80 percent stake, according to two of the sources.

Separately on Wednesday, the finance ministers of the G7 countries — which include the U.S. and Japan — said the nations ""remain committed to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" In a statement, the officials said they will keep putting pressure on Pyongyang through economic sanctions.
They could also address Trump's discussions about potentially re-entering the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. In a tweet Tuesday, the president said he does not ""like the deal for the United States.""

3645,"Walgreens profit, sales beat estimates and boosts its 2018 forecast","Walgreens Boots Alliance's quarterly profit and sales beat analysts' estimates on Wednesday, as the drugstore chain's partnerships with pharmacy benefit managers over the past year helped it fill more prescriptions and mail orders.
Shares of the biggest U.S. drugstore chain operator were up 2 percent in early trading Wednesday. Rival CVS Health's stock also rose 1 percent.
Walgreens, which has been focusing on its pharmacy business in the face of falling retail sales, added more than 20 million members through its partnership with pharmacy benefit managers such as Minnesota-based Prime Therapeutics.
This helped fill 9.1 percent more prescriptions in the quarter and drive a 5.1 percent rise in pharmacy same-store sales.
The higher number of prescriptions also comes as the United States faced its harshest flu season in decades, with flu-related doctor visits reaching a 20-year high.
Same-store sales at its retail business fell 2.7 percent, missing analysts estimates of a flat growth, according to Evercore analyst Ross Muken.
The Deerfield, Illinois-based company lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.85 and $6.05 per share from between $5.45 and $5.70 per share. Analysts were estimating $5.78 per share for the year.
The lift in forecast reflects a $350 million tax benefit for fiscal year 2018, an increase of about $150 million from the company's previous estimate.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.36 per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28 from $1.06 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.73 per share. Net sales rose 12 percent to $33.02 billion, helped in part by Walgreen's ongoing takeover of nearly 2,000 Rite Aid stores.

4598,President Trump plans to pardon former Cheney chief of staff Scooter Libby,"Taxes President Trump pardons former Cheney chief of staff Scooter Libby President Trump pardoned Scooter Libby, who was convicted in 2007 of obstructing justice, perjury and lying to the FBI. Libby, chief of staff to then-Vice President Dick Cheney, was a central figure in the leaking of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity. The special prosecutor in the Plame case, Patrick Fitzgerald, was appointed by then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey, whom Trump fired last year as FBI director. 2 Hours Ago | 00:45 
President Donald Trump on Friday pardoned Scooter Libby, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration who was convicted in 2007 of obstructing justice, perjury and lying to the FBI. 
Libby, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff, lied about how he learned the identity of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame and how he talked to reporters about her. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison, but Bush commuted the sentence. 
""I don't know Mr. Libby,"" Trump said in a statement issued by the White House. ""But for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life."" 
Members of the Bush administration had sought to discredit Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, over his claims that the administration fabricated intelligence on Iraq before the U.S. invasion in 2003. 
The pardon comes as Trump himself and members of his inner circle are under investigation by federal authorities. Special counsel Robert Mueller is reportedly looking at possible obstruction of justice by the president, as well as whether Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. 
Trump has repeatedly denied collusion and obstruction of justice. 
The special prosecutor in the Plame case, Patrick Fitzgerald, was appointed by then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey . 
Trump fired Comey as director of the FBI last year. Comey said the president made several attempts to secure his loyalty. Trump told NBC's Lester Holt that he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided to fire Comey. 
Excerpts of Comey's new memoir, ""A Higher Loyalty,"" have started to leak. In the book, which is being released next week, Comey says Trump was ""untethered to the truth."" 
Here's White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' Friday statement on the pardon: 
Today, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) to I. ""Scooter"" Lewis Libby, former Chief of Staff to Vice President Richard Cheney, for convictions stemming from a 2007 trial. President George W. Bush commuted Mr. Libby's sentence shortly after his conviction. Mr. Libby, nevertheless, paid a $250,000 fine, performed 400 hours of community service, and served two years of probation. 
In 2015, one of the key witnesses against Mr. Libby recanted her testimony, stating publicly that she believes the prosecutor withheld relevant information from her during interviews that would have altered significantly what she said. The next year, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals unanimously reinstated Mr. Libby to the bar, reauthorizing him to practice law. The Court agreed with the District of Columbia Disciplinary Counsel, who stated that Mr. Libby had presented ""credible evidence"" in support of his innocence, including evidence that a key prosecution witness had ""changed her recollection of the events in question."" 
Before his conviction, Mr. Libby had rendered more than a decade of honorable service to the Nation as a public servant at the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the White House. His record since his conviction is similarly unblemished, and he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers. 
In light of these facts, the President believes Mr. Libby is fully worthy of this pardon. ""I don't know Mr. Libby,"" said President Trump, ""but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.""",2018-04-13T14:52:00.000+03:00
7215,"Chipotle is adding drive-thru lanes, but you can't order food at them","Chipotle Mexican Grill is systematically adding drive-thru lanes to some of its new locations, but you won't be able to place an order at any of them.
The burrito chain has dealt with a very public three-year-long sales slump that crippled its stock price. To revitalize its sales and encourage diners to return, the brand has implemented strategies like digital ordering, delivery and adding new menu items that it hasn't pursued aggressively in the past.
Drive-thru windows are cropping up at Chipotle restaurants across the country, allowing customers the option of staying in their cars to get their burritos and bowls.
However, these drive-thrus are a little different from the typical fast food order and pick-up lane. Here customers don't order their food through a microphone, they do it ahead of time through Chipotle's app or an online form.
Diners are provided with a pick-up time once they place their order and can drive through the mobile order lane to grab their meal without having to go inside the store.
""[CEO] Brian [Niccol] has said very well that Chipotle has this huge opportunity ahead of us as it relates to access,"" Curt Garner, chief digital and information officer at Chipotle, told CNBC. ""We still only have 2,500 locations. There are plenty of places and occasions for us to continue to grow into. But as we've looked at access, we've also looked at it in terms of different restaurant formats and these mobile drive-thru pick-up restaurants are part of that.""
So far, Chipotle has five of these locations in the U.S. There are two stores in Ohio, and single stores in Tennessee, Texas and Massachusetts. But more are coming.
""As we are looking at our real estate pipeline, part of the criteria that has been introduced is to understand how many of those sites might lend themselves to that experience, even if we don't open them immediately with [the mobile lane] enabled,"" he said.
In Virginia, a new Chipotle outfitted with this mobile pick-up lane is expected to open by the end of the year, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.
Convenience is king ""The idea of having a mobile pick-up station or a dedicated lane makes a lot of sense because anything that makes it more convenient for the guest has been proven to drive sales,"" Peter Saleh, analyst at BTIG, told CNBC.
For many Chipotle customers who have sampled the restaurant's menu and have a go-to order, the experience of walking down the line and picking out burrito toppings is no longer an amenity, but an obstacle, Garner said. For these diners, it is more convenient to place an order via an app or website and stroll in or drive by to pick it up.
Digital orders typically take about 12 minutes to be filled, Garner said. Although, those who use the app can order a meal hours in advance, selecting the specific time they want to pick it up when they place their order.
Garner said Chipotle receives thousands of digital orders before its restaurants even open as people reserve a lunchtime slot to come in and grab their burritos and bowls.
To meet this demand, Chipotle has installed second food lines in the back of all but about 100 of its stores. These lines are manned by two employees, instead of the typical five to seven that a front line would have and are situated near the grill.
The line is about 8 feet long and 2.5 feet wide with heated shelves and an area for food storage.
""The second 'make' line is one of the aspects of Chipotle that I think is a really significant competitive advantage as it relates to digital, Garner said. ""One of the problems that companies have struggled with for a long time is having digital orders or any sort of out-of-store order come in and interrupt the flow on the main line that is servicing customers in person.""
show chapters Chipotle's new CEO on his turnaround plans, and his favorite order 1:02 PM ET Thu, 26 April 2018 | 10:41 Chipotle, in adding these mobile order lanes, will have to ensure that it can get customers through the line quickly and that the food will be hot when it is picked up.
""Convenience is king,"" David Henkes, managing partner at Technomic, told CNBC. ""The challenge is in logistics. If you don't do it well, you are going to essentially turn off more customers than you are bringing in.""
For Chipotle, that means adding things like dedicated parking spaces for mobile users who arrive before their order is prepared and texting customers when the meal is ready to be picked up.
Invisible demand At Chipotle, mobile orders have created a new problem for kitchen mangers — invisible demand.
""You have to be able to have a balance,"" Daniel Bendas, managing partner at Synergy Consultants, which worked with Dunkin' in designing its mobile lane, told CNBC. ""You can get as many orders as fast as you want, but you have to build the capacity in the kitchen to handle it ... the back of house has to predict volumes.""
Dunkin' Donuts opened a mobile order pick-up lane in February at its Quincy, Massachusetts, location.
Normally, kitchen managers man the grill, cooking up chicken and rice based on the line that forms behind the counter. However, when the orders come from people who aren't in the building, managers have to rely on data to know how much food to prep during different times of day.
Another pressure point that Chipotle has encountered is that peak hours for mobile orders don't always align with peak hours in-store. While some of these digital orders will come in during the lunch or dinner rush, folks who are ordering online often order later in the evening or heavily on the weekends. So, Chipotle has had to staff its restaurants differently to meet this new demand.
The digital dilemma Digital ordering, orders made online or via a mobile device, have become a bigger piece of restaurant industry sales in the last few years. However, it's still not a huge portion of restaurant sales.
""The problem with doing it through a drive-thru or dedicated window is most of the quick-service restaurants and even the fast-casual guys still have a very low digital percentage penetration,"" Saleh said . "" Most are sub-10 percent. So, to have to dedicate that much real estate to just digital orders probably isn't very productive yet.""
At Chipotle, digital orders accounted for 8.8 percent of total sales in the last quarter, up 40 percent from a year ago, Garner said. A Chipotle employee told CNBC that in-store orders total about $10,000 per day at his restaurant, while take-out orders are about $1,000. The employee wished to be unidentified because the information is confidential.
While digital orders are less than a tenth of the company's total sales now, Chipotle expects the number of such orders to grow, Garner said. He declined to offer a specific figure, noting that Chipotle executives will shed more light on the matter during a special investor call June 27.
While digital sales may be fewer in number, these orders have a higher average check compared with in-store purchases

7073,ANALYSIS-Brazil's wealthy farm belt backs Trump-like presidential candidate,"ANALYSIS-Brazil's wealthy farm belt backs Trump-like presidential candidate Ana Mano and Anthony Boadle Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters
CAMPO NOVO DO PARECIS, Brazil, May 17 (Reuters) - A right-wing Brazilian presidential candidate who compares himself to Donald Trump is attracting support across Brazil's farm belt, where the fiery former paratrooper may secure the funding needed for his bid to run Latin America's biggest country.
Jair Bolsonaro's early lead in national opinion polls for October's presidential race has been dismissed by many pundits because he the lacks the strong party base traditionally needed to win elections in this continent-sized country of 209 million people.
Yet the 63-year-old's tough law-and-order stance and plans to ease gun controls, plus his opposition to environmental protections and native land claims are resonating with wealthy landowners in Brazilian farm country.
Bumper stickers stating ""Bolsonaro Save Brazil"" and ""We Are All Bolsonaro"" are a common sight on pickups in Campo Novo do Parecis, a farm town in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's agricultural powerhouse.
With the jailing of Brazil's former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for corruption, Bolsonaro, a seven-term congressman, leads a fragmented field with five months to go until the election.
A poll this week showed him ahead of environmentalist Marina Silva when Lula's name is excluded.
In the midwestern farm states that drive the world's eighth-largest economy, Bolsonaro's lead grows to a commanding 10 percentage points, according to pollster Datafolha.
While those states are less populous than coastal regions, they are home to powerful landowners flush with cash from recent bumper crops, whose political donations may be key to building a nationwide campaign for Bolsonaro.
Tall and thin, with a shock of greying hair combed to one side and an intense gaze, Bolsonaro's biggest selling point in the eyes of many voters is a clean record on corruption when much of the political class has been tarred with graft scandals. With that, they are prepared to overlook his more incendiary comments.
Despite his popularity, Bolsonaro only has the backing of a small fringe party. Under Brazil's election laws, that gives him just 10 seconds of free television time when campaigning kicks off, a serious handicap in a nation where TV ads have a big impact.
Polls suggest up to 45 percent of voters remain undecided.
Bolsonaro's aides say his social media reach will make up for lost TV time, citing a Facebook following more than twice the size of Marina Silva's.
With anger at establishment parties riding high in Brazil, the brash iconoclast has compared his candidacy to Trump's 2016 campaign, stirring some voters with fiery speeches while alarming others.
Brazil's attorney general charged Bolsonaro last month with inciting discrimination against women, black people, indigenous people and gays.
He also faces a Supreme Court trial for inciting rape in a 2014 verbal attack on a congresswoman, whom he called ugly and said he ""would not rape because she did not deserve it.""
""Trump faced the same attacks I am facing - that he was a homophobe, a fascist, a racist, a Nazi - but the people believed in his platform and I was rooting for him,"" Bolsonaro told Reuters in a September interview.
Bolsonaro could not be reached for comment on this story.
CRIME IN FARM COUNTRY
Bolsonaro's hardline rhetoric on crime has also inspired grassroots organizing in the midwest region, where prosperous farms are threatened by land invasions and increasing robberies.
""If we could have rifles like ranchers in the United States, that would deter criminals,"" said farmer Flavio Giacomet. ""He is not the savior who will end corruption and crime, but of the candidates out there today, I would vote for him.""
A recent survey by Brazilian agriculture lobby CNA showed an increase in armed robbery on farms, with organized gangs seizing machinery and costly fertilizers and pesticides.
In rural parts of Mato Grosso, robberies are up 60 percent and murders jumped 44 percent in the last five years, according to data from the state government.
Bolsonaro's criticism of environmental licensing rules and state interference in the economy also ""are music to farmers' ears,"" said Endrigo Dalcin, former president of Mato Grosso grain farmers group Aprosoja.
Comments on China ""taking over"" Brazil appear not to have dented his support among farmers, although the Asian giant is by far the biggest buyer of Brazilian grains.
Bolsonaro told Reuters last year that his foreign policy priority if elected would be to strengthen ties with the Trump administration and aim to restore the United States as Brazil's top trade partner, a position it lost to China in 2009.
""I don't see Bolsonaro's rhetoric as anti-China. It is more about regulating Chinese investments in Brazil,"" said Antonio Galvan, vice president of Aprosoja. ""I don't think he is referring to Brazil not selling its products to China. That would not make any sense.""
Ever since Brazil banned corporate donations to political campaigns, candidates have targeted wealthy farmers for financing and Bolsonaro's bid will rely on rural donations.
Giacomet and other farmers told Reuters they would donate money to Bolsonaro's campaign but only if he emerges as a viable contender with a coalition of parties behind him.
BULLET, BEEF AND BIBLE LOBBY
Bolsonaro has pledged to end the expansion of indigenous reservations as native communities claim more land rights in the face of the steady advance of Brazil's agricultural frontier into what was once the Amazon rainforest.
He supports changing laws to allow commercial agriculture and mining on reservations, backing bills that could clear an increasingly conservative Congress.
Bolsonaro was the only presidential hopeful to appear this month at the inauguration of Brazil's biggest farm equipment fair, the Agrishow expo in Sao Paulo's sugarcane belt.
Supporters there broke into chants and he was cheered when he climbed aboard a tractor and revved up the engine. He said his connection with the crowd came from his honesty and religious convictions.
""We will not make a deal with the Devil to get elected,"" said Bolsonaro, whose middle name means 'Messiah'. ""Our commitment is to God and the people.""
Bolsonaro's rise is part of a sharp rightward swing in Brazilian politics, led by market-friendly President Michel Temer who took over from impeached leftist Dilma Rousseff in 2016, ending 14 years of rule by Lula's Workers Party.
Despite Brazil's reputation for tolerance, a conservative alliance of evangelical Christians, farm state lawmakers and pro-gun politicians has steadily advanced in Congress, holding 230 of the 513 seats in the lower house.
This broad caucus, popularly known as the ""Bullet, Beef and Bible Lobby"", wants to ease gun sales, tighten Brazil's already restrictive abortion laws and give Congress final say in defining indigenous reservations all planks in Bolsonaro's platform.
The CNA farm lobby said it does not endorse presidential candidates, nor will the Congressional farm caucus, whose members come from different parties. But that is not dampening enthusiasm in rural Brazil.
""The whole town is campaigning hard for him,"" said Gilvia Casarin, a bank manager in Campo Novo do Parecis. ""They cannot think of a better name than his.""

However, many consumers aren't doing so, according to a new survey from CreditCards.com .
In fact, 70 percent of those who asked to have their annual fee waived or reduced were successful. Yet only 18 percent of card holders made this request.
Consumers were even more successful when they asked for late fee waivers. Eighty-four percent of individuals who asked for a late fee waiver were granted their most recent request. Yet just 29 percent of consumers asked for these breaks.
""It's a crazy competitive time in the credit card space, and banks are basically bending over backwards to attract new customers and retain current ones,"" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com.
A lot of credit card holders fail to ask for these deals because they didn't know they could or didn't think they could be successful, according to Schulz.

There are two other areas where consumers can also advocate for better offers: higher credit limits, where 85 percent of those who made requests saw them granted; and lower interest rates, which had a 56 percent success rate for those who asked.
Petitioning for a higher credit limit was most popular overall with consumers, 43 percent of whom asked for it. Yet, it is the one change on the list that could hurt consumers the most when it comes to getting rid of their debts, Schulz noted.

Leading the pack is iPhone maker Apple , with a market cap of $877 billion. In second place is Google parent Alphabet at $757 billion, followed by Amazon at $754 billion and Microsoft at $740 billion.
Tipping his hat to Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who came up with the concept of the race to $1 trillion in a recent research note on Microsoft , Cramer decided to look at all four contenders and speculate on which one might cross the ""finish line"" first.
Apple At first, Apple seemed like the clear favorite, with a big lead on its competition and the well-respected CEO, Tim Cook , at the helm, Cramer said.
But then the market started spotting chinks in the consumer tech giant's armor as analysts lamented Apple's weaker-than-expected iPhone X sales . But Cramer argued that Apple's service revenues and the potential for billions of dollars in capital returns could make up for the losses.
""That has kept Apple in the lead at what I now regard as the race's midpoint,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But this morning we got a piece of research from ... Mizuho that shortened Apple's distance from the pack rather dramatically.""
Amazon With the competition mounting, Cramer said Apple's lead could still fade. He turned to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' annual shareholder letter , released Wednesday.
In it, Bezos wrote that Amazon's paid delivery service, Amazon Prime, now has 100 million worldwide members and that more people joined Prime in 2017 than in any other year.
And despite President Donald Trump's ostensibly tax-related grudge against the e-commerce giant, the company seems to be weathering the Twitter-storm . Also in the shareholder letter, Bezos wrote that over five billion items were shipped to Prime members globally just in 2017.
""If the president stops tweeting and the [Supreme] Court rules in favor of the third-party sellers [and] Amazon's lucrative web services business stays strong, [the] trophy goes to Amazon,"" Cramer said.
Alphabet Cramer always thought that the stock of Google parent Alphabet could one day challenge the stock of Apple on price if Apple ever slipped up.
""Alphabet has come back into the race after what can only be described as a series of lost races where it was hung on guidance ,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
He grew even more bullish after Deutche Bank released a research note on Thursday labeling Alphabet a ""buy"" on the strength of Google Cloud, YouTube and its search business.
""An in-line quarter is what [the Deutsche analyst] is saying could push this stock ... to a photo finish,"" Cramer said.
Microsoft After Morgan Stanley's note said that Microsoft's recent earnings results and guidance ""should support a path to $1 trillion,"" Cramer didn't want to count this tech giant out, either.
""I have to agree,"" he said. ""[CEO] Satya Nadella has switched the company's focus from the slow-growing Windows products and enterprise software to the cloud, namely Microsoft's incredibly fast-growing Azure business, as well as its shrewd LinkedIn acquisition . I like the prospects.""
Conclusions At this point, Cramer admitted that ""anything can happen"" to push any one of these market leaders to the $1 trillion finish.
""Right now, though, Amazon's the one that could break free, break away from this three-horse pack to challenge Apple,"" he said. ""Can it overtake the favorite? Not if Apple surprises to the upside this quarter. But if it misses and Amazon delivers, the roses may very well belong to Jeff Bezos .""

6278,Advisor to right-wing Brazil candidate says privatize it all,"Advisor to right-wing Brazil candidate says privatize it all Marcela Ayres Published 20 Hours Ago Reuters
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 28 (Reuters) - Brazil should privatize everything from lender Banco do Brasil to oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA, the main economic adviser to leading presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro told Reuters, underscoring the far-right congressman's overtures to the business community.
Investment banker Paulo Guedes, currently a partner at investment firm Bozano Investimentos Ltda, said asset sales could help the federal administration cut debt and fund cash-hungry local governments.
""Sell it all,"" he said in a late Friday interview at his office in Rio de Janeiro. ""Privatizing cautiously, bashfully, just won't do.""
His remarks contrast with previous statements by Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has led early presidential polls excluding jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Bolsonaro himself has praised the nationalist, state-driven economic policies of Brazil's military government in the 1970s.
Guedes shrugged off Bolsonaro's contradictory remarks on economic policy, saying other politicians did not get the same scrutiny for changing their minds.
""If he came looking for me, he does not defend that anymore. I am where I've always been, my ideas have been the same for 30 years,"" said Guedes, who holds a PhD from the University of Chicago.
Privatizing all state firms would raise around 800 billion reais ($215 billion), he said enough to reduce federal debt by a fifth.
That agenda would make Bolsonaro the most prominent of a group of candidates marrying conservative social positions to supply-side economics as Brazil heads to its most hard-to-predict presidential election in decades.
Bolsonaro has often been a focus of controversy due to aggressive comments about women, homosexuals and racial minorities, while defending Brazil's military government. Yet his law-and-order rhetoric and plans to ease gun controls have resonated with many voters, especially in Brazil's booming farm country.
The unpopular President Michel Temer, who pursued privatizations but struggled to close a gaping budget deficit as corruption charges weakened his hand in Congress, has scrapped plans to run for re-election.
The field is now split among a wide range of candidates looking to fill the void left by the bribery conviction against leftist leader Lula, who had been consistently leading ballots.
Guedes said he supported some of the reforms implemented by Temer, such as a constitutional amendment limiting growth of public spending and a higher interest rate for subsidized loans from state development bank BNDES.
He also defended a far more ambitious tax reform than Temer had put forward, proposing a single, value-added federal tax to replace Brazil's notoriously complicated tax system.

3099,Pfizer's rare heart disease drug succeeded in a late-stage study,"Pfizer said on Thursday its drug tafamidis, for a rare and fatal disease associated with progressive heart failure, met the main goal in a late-stage study.
The company's clinical study investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of an oral dose of tafamidis capsules compared with a placebo in 441 patients.
Pfizer said tafamidis showed a statistically significant reduction in deaths and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared with a placebo at 30 months. The data also showed that tafamidis was generally well tolerated by the enrolled patients.
Tafamidis was being tested for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy, a condition that results from deposits of transthyretin protein in the heart, which leads to eventual heart failure.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted tafamidis a 'fast track' designation in June last year. The designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review process for certain drugs and vaccines for serious conditions.
Currently, there are no approved medications in the United States for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy.",2018-03-29T21:44:00.000+03:00
6184,Trump reportedly asked the Pentagon to consider a US troop reduction in South Korea,"President Donald Trump has asked the Pentagon to look into reducing the presence of American troops in South Korea , The New York Times reported on Thursday, citing ""several people briefed on the deliberations.""
The sources didn't disclose whether Trump asked for full or partial withdrawal of U.S. forces, according to the report. But they said the president didn't put out the directive as a bargaining chip in his upcoming meeting with North Korea .
Neither the White House nor the U.S. Department of Defense replies to CNBC emails requesting comment on the report.
Trump is expected to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in coming weeks to push for the hermit nation's nuclear weapons disarmament.
Kim had earlier met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in , and the two were said to agree to work toward a peace treaty — which would officially end the Korean War.
U.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea since the conflict's armistice in 1953. A peace treaty between the two Koreas could reduce the need for the more than 20,000 American soldiers still stationed there, according to the report.
Trump has long wanted to withdraw American troops from South Korea, claiming that the U.S. hasn't been properly compensated for its military presence, the Times noted. South Korea, however, has said it wants U.S. troops to stay even if a peace treaty is signed with North Korea.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
The official, Kelly Sadler, made the comment while discussing McCain's opposition to Trump's pick for CIA director, Gina Haspel , according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
The two people who attended the closed-door meeting told the AP they felt shocked and stunned by the remark.
In a statement, White House did not dispute that Sadler made the comment at the meeting.
""We respect Senator McCain's service to our nation and he and his family are in our prayers during this difficult time,"" said the White House's statement.
The Hill newspaper first reported Sadler's comment.

""The fact is, is John McCain — it worked on John. That's why they call him 'Songbird John,'"" McInerney said on-air Thursday morning.
McCain was a Navy pilot who was beaten in captivity during the Vietnam War.

The ailing senator has urged his colleagues to reject Haspel. He said Wednesday that he believes she's a patriot who loves the country but ""her refusal to acknowledge torture's immorality is disqualifying.""
Haspel faced grilling Wednesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee about her role overseeing some CIA operations after the Sept. 11 attacks. She told senators that she doesn't believe torture works as an interrogation technique.
As for the president, he and McCain have had a troubled relationship.
As a GOP presidential candidate in 2015, Trump said McCain was ""not a war hero"" because he was captured in Vietnam, adding, ""I like people who weren't captured.""
Last July, McCain became the deciding vote against the GOP health care repeal with a dramatic thumbs-down. Trump later told the Conservative Political Action Conference that ""except for one Senator, who came into a room at three o'clock in the morning and went like that"" — Trump gave a thumbs-down — ""we would have had health care (reform), too.""
The crowd booed, and Trump added, ""I won't use his name.""

But the prospects for the G20 finance leaders to agree on specific global rules and mention them in a joint communique are low, officials said. ""Discussions will focus on anti-money laundering steps and consumer protection, rather than how cryptocurrency trading could affect the banking system,"" one of the officials said. Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters Bobby Yip | Reuters A cryptocurrency mining computer equipped with four cooling fans is seen on display at a computer mall in Hong Kong, January 29, 2018. 
Japan will urge its G20 counterparts at a meeting next week to beef up efforts to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering, a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of 20 major economies will meet in Buenos Aires on March 19-20, with cryptocurrencies set to be on the agenda. 
But the prospects for the G20 finance leaders to agree on specific global rules and mention them in a joint communique are low, given differences in each country's approach, the official said, a view echoed by another official involved in G20 talks. 
""Discussions will focus on anti-money laundering steps and consumer protection, rather than how cryptocurrency trading could affect the banking system,"" one of the officials said. 
""The general feeling among the G20 members is that applying too stringent regulations won't be good."" 
The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a 37-nation group set up by the G7 industrial powers to fight illicit finance, will report to the G20 its findings on ways to keep cryptocurrencies from being used for money laundering. 
Japanese policymakers fear that while there is broad consensus among the G20 nations on the need for such steps, some nations have looser regulations than others, which leaves loopholes for money laundering, the official said. 
Japan was the first country to adopt a national system to oversee cryptocurrency trading, although it carried out checks on several exchanges this year after the theft of $530 million from one exchange, Coincheck Inc. 
France and Germany have said they will make joint proposals to regulate the bitcoin cryptocurrency market. 
A head of the European Union's watchdog said a short-term strategy could be to focus on applying anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules, warning consumers of the risk of trading in cryptocurrencies and preventing banks from holding them. 
The trick would be to apply regulations to protect consumers and prevent illicit activity, without stifling innovation in the fast-growing crypto-currency and fintech sectors, the Japanese officials said.",2018-03-13T06:48:00.000+02:00

Facebook announced on Wednesday afternoon that it would tighten restrictions on third-party access to user data. Similar mobile dating apps Bumble and OkCupid do not appear to have been affected by the new privacy measures. CNBC.com Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images 
Popular dating app Tinder was briefly broken for some users on Wednesday due to outages in its Facebook login process. 
The app led users to an endless cycle of login errors and malfunctioned after sweeping changes to Facebook 's restrictions on third-party apps and terms of service . 
""This was part of the changes that we announced today, and we are working with Tinder to address this issue,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC. 
Facebook's CTO announced a slew of new privacy measures on Wednesday afternoon as a response to the ongoing criticism the social media company has faced regarding its handling of user data. Facebook had previously allowed third-party apps like Tinder to request user data, but today announced that they will no longer allow apps to ask for access to personal information. 
Tinder's woes could signal widespread implications for other developers that rely on the massive social networking platform. 
Tinder requires its users to link their profiles to a Facebook account for verification and profile details. The user is required to authorize Tinder's use of their personal data, then the app pulls in users' name, age, photos, interests and more. 
When users open the Tinder app, they are asked to sign in via Facebook and led to a dialog box asking for additional permissions. Tapping ""Ask Me"" sends users into an endless cycle of unsuccessful logins and faulty permissions. 
Similar mobile dating apps Bumble and OkCupid (which, like Tinder, is an Match Group company) did not appear to be affected by the new privacy rules despite their requests for personal user information like birthdays and friends lists. Tinder collects users' interests and displays them on profiles whereas the other two apps do not.

4514,GOP Sen. Bob Corker will not campaign against the Democrat running for his seat,"Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. 
Outgoing Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn., will not campaign against the Democrat running to replace him this year. 
The senator called Democratic former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen a ""friend"" with whom he has worked for more than 20 years. Corker said Wednesday he does not plan to attack Bredesen, who aims to upset the leading Republican, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, in the red state. 
""I'm not going to campaign against someone who I've been a friend with and worked with, you know? So that's the way it's going to be,"" Corker said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast. Corker has declined to run for a third Senate term in November. 
Despite the challenges Bredesen faces in a state President Donald Trump won with more than 60 percent of the vote, Corker told reporters he thinks the former governor has about a 6 percentage point advantage in the race right now. The winner of the seat will help to determine whether Republicans hold or expand their narrow 51-seat majority in the Senate. 
Corker also told the audience that ""any Republican senator who hasn't been conflicted over this presidency is either comatose or is pretty useless in their blindness."" 
Democrats face a daunting task in trying to take the Senate. The party's senators and independents who caucus with them will defend 26 seats in November, including 10 in states Trump carried in 2016. Republicans only face re-election in nine states. 
A competitive Tennessee race could change the calculus for the parties. Democrat Doug Jones' special election win in deep-red Alabama last year not only narrowed the GOP majority in the upper chamber but also gave Democrats hopes about competing in more challenging states this year. 
Corker has shown some support for Blackburn, who has served in Congress since 2003 and pledged to back Trump's agenda. On Wednesday, he said he sent her campaign a contribution check for an undisclosed amount of money, adding that he is ""supportive."" However, he said he never had the close working relationship with Blackburn that he did with Bredesen. 
Corker said he worked closely with Bredesen when the senator served as mayor of Chattanooga and Bredesen was governor. 
Bredesen, 74, is seen as having potential appeal across the state because he served two terms as governor. He won a 2006 re-election bid with nearly 70 percent of the vote. 
Bredesen has had to tread carefully in the red state. He has tried to avoid GOP efforts to tie him to Washington's Democratic leaders. He also said in a campaign ad that he is ""not running against Donald Trump."" 
Bredesen thinks taking back the Senate will be daunting for Democrats, even if he wins. 
""I don't think it's possible. I'll be honest with you. My expectation is that I will be in the minority in the Senate,"" he told The New York Times . ",2018-04-18T18:05:00.000+03:00

6736,Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are becoming a hot trend in the job market,"The cryptocurrency industry is getting so hot that dedicated career services are popping up.
On Thursday, CoinDesk, a leading source of cryptocurrency news and organizer of major industry conferences, launched an online ""Career Center"" with job listings.
It's ""no secret demand for blockchain skills is high and that finding talent is a real difficulty,"" Jacob Donnelly, director of marketing, said in a statement. CoinDesk is also hosting a career fair along with its Consensus conference in New York this month.
Listings of ""blockchain"" skills skyrocketed more than 6,000 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, online freelancing database Upwork said in a report Tuesday. That's far and away the hottest skill on Upwork, and a slight change from the fourth quarter when ""bitcoin"" was the fastest-growing skill and blockchain wasn't even on the list.
""There's an explosion of activity around cryptocurrencies because of that extremely volatile, but extremely exciting, nature of bitcoin. There's a lot of millionaires made overnight and drawn a lot of people in,"" said Andy Challenger, vice president at placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. ""There's sort of a gold rush mentality.""
Bitcoin grabbed public attention last year when the price of one coin shot up more than 2,000 percent in 12 months to above $19,000. The cryptocurrency was the first application of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a permanent, secure record of transactions between two parties. Now, start-ups and corporations alike are testing ways to use blockchain in a host of areas such as energy distribution and supply chain management.
Last year, IBM , Microsoft and Accenture accounted for roughly half of $700 million in global revenues related to blockchain, according to Oppenheimer analysts Shaul Eyal and Tanner Hoban. They noted estimates that the size of the blockchain industry could grow into the tens of billions.
""As the technology matures, we think those blockchain engineers will see absolutely high demand,"" Eyal said in a phone interview. ""Right now it's a little bit of a wild, Wild West with many entrepreneurs trying to jockey for position.""
Some analysts say taking the risk in a cryptocurrency role could position someone for a key role in a major corporation down the road.
""If you enter the crypto start-up space and gain some experience in the underlying blockchain technology, it will serve you really well,"" Challenger said. ""It's an industry that requires a certain amount of expertise, and that's a rare commodity.""
The cryptocurrency industry is still small — the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies to date is about the size of one typical S&P 500 company, according to CoinMarketCap. And as with any nascent trend, the risks are high.
Sometimes a start-up has a good idea, brings people to work on a prototype, but doesn't get funding, said David Gadd, director at tech recruiting firm Proxime Solutions. So the company has to close down.
Still, the Canada-based recruiter said many people are coming out of government and insurance companies to work in blockchain and many financial institutions are also building up their own blockchain teams. Although ""no one wants to be seen as the first company to come out with a blockchain project, they have a team ready to go sitting on the bench,"" Gadd said.",2018-05-04T18:45:00.000+03:00
5618,Timing of Trump's latest tariff threat against China is 'unfortunate': Former US deputy trade rep,"It's unfortunate that President Donald Trump has chosen to add fuel to an already heated spat with China just as officials from both countries have signaled their willingness to negotiate to avoid escalating trade tensions, said a former deputy U.S. trade representative.
""The timing is especially unfortunate,"" Miriam Sapiro, a former deputy and acting U.S. trade representative during the Obama administration, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday.
""(The latest development) just makes it more difficult for the Chinese government to engage. Either China matches this escalation, plays tit-for-tat, or it takes a high road and score significant leadership point,"" she added.
Trump on Thursday proposed $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese products. The president said that's a response to China's ""unfair retaliation"" against an up to $60 billion of tariffs that the U.S. had earlier announced.
Given that China previously said ""it is only polite to reciprocate,"" Sapiro said it's unlikely that the Asian economic giant would back off.
That would heighten the prospect of a trade war between the two largest economies in the world, which would then hurt the ""very U.S. companies that the White House has been trying to help,"" noted Sapiro, who's now managing director of Sard Verbinnen & Co's New York office.

It's all part of the retailer's updated growth strategy announced late last year, which called for roughly 200 Gap and Banana Republic stores to close by 2020.
""If you think about it, the real estate we have exited tends to be clustered at some of the older ... malls that the customer isn't as excited about anymore,"" Gap CEO Art Peck told CNBC. ""We've moved to where the customer is,"" which tends to be more open-air centers and street-level retail, he said. 
In addition to opening new locations, Old Navy will also be remodeling roughly 150 stores over the next few months. The majority of those locations will get upgraded fitting rooms, bathrooms and checkout areas, among other more modern fixtures. About 10 percent of the 150 stores, though, will receive a full makeover. Three stores are being entirely rebuilt due to hurricane damage. 
""We're really focused on technology that delivers a meaningful benefit to customers,"" Peck said. That includes making upgrades to the retailer's mobile apps, allowing shoppers to check available stock in stores, quickly browse customer reviews on items and keep track of loyalty points. The company is also trialing ""buy online pick up in store"" in a handful of locations. 
Old Navy's moves come as apparel retailers across the U.S. have been fighting to keep pace with Amazon.com , which is positioned to this year to become the No. 1 clothing retailer in U.S., according to Morgan Stanley. 
""I have huge respect for what they're doing,"" Peck said about Amazon. ""I would characterize [Amazon.com] as excellent and hyper-efficient for buying, but it's not a great discovery platform. ... And a big part of fashion apparel is discovery."" 
Faced with mounting competition, Gap has been dialing back on excessive promotions for some of its brands and keeping a closer watch on inventory. It's also been pushing Old Navy for shoppers who enjoy browsing off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx and Ross Stores in search of a deal. 
""Old Navy and Athleta remain attractive bright spots,"" Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note to clients last week. ""Overall, in our view, these two brands will continue to be the cornerstone of growth for GPS and we like the strategic shift in store footprint towards these two brands."" 
Chen said that if the two labels ""can continue impressive year-on-year momentum,"" Gap's earnings should go higher. 
In the most recent quarter, same-store sales at Old Navy jumped 9 percent , driving an overall same-store sales increase of 5 percent for Gap Inc.

5463,This tech exec's big career regret has to do with golf,"Rhonda Vetere is an executive with more than 20 years of experience in business and tech. Prior to her current role as president of data and analytics at health care company nThrive, she served in leadership positions at JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Estée Lauder, where she was the chief technology officer for the beauty brand. 
Like many professionals, Vetere has received lots of advice throughout her career on how to climb the corporate ladder and have meaningful success. While she put into practice most of the wisdom given to her, she says there is one tip that she wishes she had listened to earlier in her career.
""One of my mentors told me in my 20s to play golf and I laughed at him,"" she tells CNBC Make It . ""I said I am from a sports background, and I do triathalons, but I am not a golfer.""
Although the advice didn't make sense to her at the time, Vetere says she later realized that her mentor was trying to tell her that success is about more than keeping your head down and meeting deadlines. He wanted her to know that you also have to build relationships with people if you want to go far. 
""I finally picked it up in my 40s and I wish I had done it sooner,"" she says. ""A lot of things get done on that golf course that are not in a meeting room.""
Rhonda Vetere, President of Data and Analytics at nThrive Former CEO of the Executive Women's Golf Association Pam Swensen agrees with Vetere and her mentor. She says that if she could give one piece of advice to emerging business women today, it would be to add golf to their skill set. 
""Few, if any, activities can duplicate the power of golf to boost one's career regardless of gender,"" she writes for CNBC . ""The game provides unmatchable networking time with clients, prospects and colleagues, including coveted access to senior management.""
In a survey that included members from the Executive Women Golf Association, 79 percent of respondents agreed that they can get to know a person better on the course and 73 percent said that golf has helped them to develop new relationships.
""It remains important to provide women with greater access to the game and more confidence to leave the office for a few hours with colleagues and clients to gain the unique business advantages only golf offers,"" adds Swensen. 
Vetere, who now plays golf on her summer Fridays, says the golf course opened her eyes to just how important out-of-office relationship building can be. 
""Often times we think, 'Oh, I have to get this email out or I have to do this transaction,' and life is not about that,"" says Vetere. ""It is about relationships.""

64,SALT in the wound: How high-tax states are working around federal tax breaks,"High-tax states plan workarounds to the federal SALT deduction The GOP tax code caps the SALT deduction at $10,000. But the average SALT deduction for taxpayers in New York, New Jersey and California has been about $20,000. Politicians in blue states across the country are devising ways to workaround the federal code. SHARES Getty Images Residents wait in line to pay taxes at the Fairfax County Government Center December 28, 2017 in Fairfax, Virginia. 
Officials in New York, New Jersey and California are working to reshape their tax codes to ease residents' pain from new limits to federal deductions for state, local and property taxes. 
Starting this year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , the GOP's new tax code, caps taxpayers' deductions on their property, state and local incomes taxes (SALT)  at $10,000. 
But in 2015, the average New Yorker's SALT deduction was more than $22,000 . In New Jersey and California, the average deductions were around $18,000. 
Previously, there was no limit on the extent to which taxpayers could deduct these local levies. The change means many residents in these states — and many others — will now pay more to the federal government. (See chart below.) 
""We're attempting to come up with ways to negate and blunt the harsh and unfair Republican tax policy,"" said Kevin de León, the Democratic leader of the California State Senate. 
To combat the new SALT deduction cap, politicians are proposing creative concepts. Some of the ideas include granting a charitable deduction — which remains uncapped — after filers pay property taxes. Another idea does away with income taxes and applies a statewide payroll tax to be paid for by employers — which is deductible to them. 
""The whole intent is to ensure that you get the benefit of the deduction you would otherwise lose,"" said Joseph Bankman, the Ralph M. Parsons Professor of Law and Business at Stanford Law School. 
The White House has expressed its disapproval. 
""I hope that the states are more focused on cutting their budgets and giving tax cuts to their people in their states than they are in trying to evade the law,"" said Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury Secretary, at a press briefing this month. ""The whole intent is to ensure that you get the benefit of the deduction you would otherwise lose."" -Joseph Bankman, Professor, Stanford Law School 
However, Robert Mujica, New York's budget director, said it's impossible for the state to not react. 
""What Washington did to New York was say 'We're going to basically change the laws entirely and upend your system, oh, and by the way, don't make any changes to adjust to it',"" he said. 
Here's how three key states are working to combat the new tax law. California Michael Tullberg | Getty Images California State Senate leader Kevin de Leon. 
In early January, California Senate leader de León introduced a bill that would allow residents to pay some of their state taxes to the California Excellence Fund, a state charity. In turn, taxpayers would be able to deduct the amount of their charitable contribution on their federal returns. 
So if, say, a San Francisco resident's SALT taxes were $15,000, they could pay the first $10,000 as normal, and then contribute the remaining $5,000 of their state tax bill to the California Excellence Fund as a charitable donation. That would then make their total SALT taxes deductible. ""It means sitting down with an accountant in December instead of March."" -Brian Galle, Professor of law, Georgetown University 
""It's pretty easy,"" said Brian Galle, a law professor at Georgetown University who specializes in taxation. ""It follows a mechanism that many taxpayers have done every year."" 
What might require adjustment is that people would have to figure out their taxes months earlier than they're used to. That's because people would need to know their state tax bill and make that charitable contribution before the end of the year to receive the benefit. 
""It means sitting down with an accountant in December instead of March,"" Galle said. 
Educating Californians about the system would be a major part of the plan, de Leon said. New York Getty Images New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. 
Absent of any changes, the state estimates that New Yorkers would pay an additional $14 billion a year in taxes. 
So earlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Department of Taxation and Finance to craft ways for the state to respond to the GOP tax bill. The department emerged with a slew of proposals to reshape New York's taxation. 
""All of them are designed to give back to New Yorkers what the federal government took away,"" Mujica said. 
The first proposal basically mirrors California's plan. Residents would contribute their SALT taxes beyond the $10,000 cap to a state charity, and therefore make their entire bill eligible for deduction. 
The other major proposal would shift income taxes to payroll taxes — or from employees who can no longer deduct taxes to employers who still can. 
Employers, facing a higher tax bill, would most likely reduce wages. But the state would give employees a wage credit, which would be deductible. ""What Washington did to New York was say 'We're going to basically change the laws entirely and upend your system, oh, and by the way, don't make any changes to adjust to it'"" -Robert Mujica, Director, New York State Division of the Budget 
So if an employee makes $75,000 a year, and the employer lowers her salary to $65,000 because it's now paying a new payroll tax, the state would give the employee a wage credit for $10,000. The employee is back where she started (at $75,000) — but now she has her state taxes shielded from federal taxation. 
This proposal could reach more people than the charitable deduction, Galle said. 
""You might be benefiting all your constituents,"" he said. ""Not just the ones who itemize."" Although it might require workers to accept an immediate pay cut. 
Mujica said these proposals are a top priority for the state. 
""We'd like to get legislative drafted in the next few weeks,"" he said. New Jersey",2018-01-20T18:00:00.000+02:00
3884,7 things you need to stop doing to become richer and more successful,"The ability to align your daily habits with your long-term goals is a powerful tool for attaining wealth and success. When investing, for example, today's money management decisions determine the scope of tomorrow's financial freedom.
Though we all aspire for success, few take the time to reflect and eliminate counterproductive habits. It can be a challenge to determine which habits are getting in your way, but once you know, act on that knowledge, and positive results will follow.
Here are seven attitudes, actions, and routines that you need to eliminate in order to move forward.
Playing it safe by avoiding challenges Doubts and insecurities have no place in your mindset. It may seem natural to gravitate toward things that make you feel comfortable but, really, it is life's challenges that force you to learn and grow.
Move toward your goals by staying hungry for opportunities that will stretch your limits.
In the world of finance, an investor will reap higher returns by seeking opportunities in the global markets . The process is not necessarily easy, and in fact it can be quite challenging, but it increases the potential for success.

Debt is dangerous. Living with any form of debt is carrying a heavy burden. You may try to move ahead, but it will inevitably slow you down, as well as add to your daily stress.
The only solution is to completely kick it out of your life. Form a viable plan to pay off debt as soon as possible and commit to avoiding it in the future, so that you can focus on greater financial goals.
Saying 'yes' to everything ""People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully."" —Steve Jobs
Your success lies in your ability to distinguish tasks that are important from ones that you can either delay or delegate . This strategy empowers you to accomplish more, as you allow yourself to focus on what's truly essential for your future success.
Living beyond your means Most billionaires actually live very simple day-to-day lives. The wisdom of their small decisions is a reflection of their larger, more effective actions. Jeff Bezos , Amazon Founder and CEO, drives a Honda Accord, while Mark Zuckerberg , Founder and CEO of Facebook, prefers a Volkswagen Hatchback. Obviously, the ultra-wealthy can afford the latest in luxury vehicles, but instead, they opt for the economical. They would rather focus their energy on more important things.
Some people spend hard-earned money without considering long-term consequences. Impulsive purchases, even small ones, can become habits that cripple your financial strategy . Imagine if you had saved or invested all that money.
Being overconfident While self-confidence is a key to achieving greatness, arrogance can be self-sabotage.
Try to take personal bias out of the equation. To advance in your career and personal life, take the time to listen to those around you. Their thoughts and criticisms are instrumental to your growth as an individual.
According to Elon Musk , it's very important to have a feedback loop in which you are constantly thinking about what you've done and how to improve upon it.

Stop living with limiting beliefs. Even if it takes more effort, go for it — successful people have larger-than-life goals and mindsets .
The same thing goes for your financial success. Create life-changing goals. Establish strategies based on your needs and priorities and stay determined to implement your strategies, despite adversity.
""Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do something you don't necessarily want to do, to get a result you would really like to have."" —Andy Andrews, self-help author
Dwelling on past mistakes (and not learning from them) You can never turn back time, so don't try to live in the past. In the process of making your dreams a reality, you have to maintain a forward-looking perspective . The best kind of goal is one that you will work toward no matter what, setting aside failures and errors that you encounter along the way.
Treat mistakes as learning experiences that make you stronger and better as a person. ""Shark Tank"" investor Barbara Corcoran once said that her best successes came on the heels of failures.
Summary Like a self-made millionaire, you have to start somewhere, so start with your primary goal. Ask yourself, What do I want to achieve? What kind of person do I want to become? Then begin by eliminating personal habits and outside influences that are not in alignment with what you truly want.
Once you've begun this process, your professional and personal life will fall into place.

7208,Growth in China's services sector increased in April,"GDP outlook Growth in China's services sector increased in April Growth in China's service sector picked up in April as new business and employment grew at a faster rate, a private survey showed on Friday. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) climbed to 52.9 in April from March's four-month low of 52.3. Published 16 Hours Ago Reuters VCG | Getty Images Job seekers crowd to the annual job fair on April 13, 2018 in Zhengzhou, Henan Province of China.
Growth in China's service sector picked up in April as new business and employment grew at a faster rate, a private survey showed on Friday, signalling a solid rise in a sector that Beijing is counting on to maintain economic growth.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) climbed to 52.9 in April from March's four-month low of 52.3, though it remained weaker than levels in 2018's first two months. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
The findings were similar to those of an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector earlier this week, which showed April's services PMI rising to 54.8 from March's 54.6.
Strength in services bodes well for policymakers aiming to boost domestic demand at a time a possible trade war with the United States causes concern there could be a loss of economic momentum in China.
As the Caixin services survey came out, top-level Trump administration officials are in China for important trade talks.
The services sector already accounts for more than half of China's economy, with rising wages giving its consumers more spending power at home and abroad.
Growth in new business orders accelerated in April due to improving market conditions, greater tourist numbers and new product offerings. This led to the first back-to-back monthly increase in outstanding work for Chinese services providers since mid-2007, the survey showed.
New projects and efforts to raise operating capacity contributed to a further rise in employment in April, albeit the increase in the growth rate was only marginal.
Inflationary pressures continued to cool across China's service sector as input prices grew at the slowest pace in April in six months while the increase in prices charged by services providers was only modest.
Business expectations towards the year ahead, improved slightly in April, supported by ongoing company expansions, projects of improving market conditions and increasing client bases.
Caixin's composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services sectors showed a similar pattern of firming growth, rising to 52.3 in April from the previous month's 51.8, indicating relatively stable economic growth.
""The operating conditions of the service sector improved more significantly than the manufacturing sector,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
""Overall, expectations regarding future output weakened due to reduced optimism across the manufacturing sector, which may further weigh on investment in the manufacturing industry.""
Economists expect China's economic growth to ease to 6.5 percent this year, in line with Beijing's target but below a forecast-beating 6.9 percent in 2017, with a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector and the trade dispute with the United States seen as key risks, a Reuters poll showed.",2018-05-04T05:23:00.000+03:00

379,An obscure tax law might force Newman's Own to put itself up for sale,"2 Hours Ago | 01:53 
Newman's Own, the popular purveyor of philanthropic pasta sauce, will be forced to put itself up for sale or pay crushing fines this year due to an obscure provision in the tax code. 
The household brand is facing a tax bill of up to 200 percent on the majority of its business — a penalty so steep company executives say it would effectively put them out of business. The only alternative, they say, is for the private foundation established by the late Hollywood legend Paul Newman to relinquish control of the company that bears his name. 
""It's not a possibility — it's an absolute certainty that we would have to divest,"" Bob Forrester, chief executive of the Newman's Own Foundation, told CNBC. 
On Wednesday, Forrester is slated to meet with lawmakers in hopes of a securing a last-minute legislative fix, potentially as part of any deal to fund the government past Jan. 19. Newman's Own had hoped to tuck a solution into the Republicans' sweeping tax plan that passed late last year, but it was dropped over fears that the provision did not comply with procedural rules in the Senate. Previous attempts to exempt Newman's Own from the hefty fines have garnered bipartisan support. 
""It ultimately fell victim to the Senate's strict budget rules that guided our tax reform effort,"" Sen. John Thune , R-S.D., said in a statement to CNBC. ""I remain a strong supporter of this protection."" 
This is not the future that Newman, the late blue-eyed Hollywood heartthrob and star of ""Cool Hand Luke"" and other hits, envisioned when he established the company more than 30 years ago. The business was a side gig for the master of marinara, a way to create a permanent and ongoing source of funding for Newman's philanthropic work. From the start, the Hollywood star donated all of the company's profits to charities. In 2005 Newman's private foundation was set up and now it distributes the money. 
The model was a success for decades. Newman's Own is now a $500 million enterprise, executives say. Its pasta sauces are a staple on grocery store shelves across the country, from the original traditional marinara to the zesty Sockarooni. The company's lineup includes salad dressing, lemonade and pet food. 
The company's profits have allowed the foundation to expand its footprint around the world. It donated more than $30 million to more than 600 charities last year, with much of its giving focused on improving nutrition, helping children with life-threatening diseases and supporting veterans. 
""It's not a tax break,"" Forrester said. ""This is more more like clemency, if you will. It allows us to continue to be in business and pay our corporate taxes."" 
But the model broke down after Newman died nearly a decade ago. U.S. tax law prohibits private foundations from owning more than a 20 percent stake in a for-profit company after the founder's death. The penalty for not complying is a 200 percent fine on the value of any additional holdings. 
""The call it a tax … but the intent is obvious,"" said Jeff Brown, head of government affairs for the foundation. 
The 1969 law was designed to target tax avoidance, but Newman's Own executives say no one envisioned at the time that anyone would want to start a company that gave away all its money – until Paul Newman came along. 
Since then, his work has inspired other entrepreneurs to establish similar models. About two dozen smaller philanthropic businesses are working with Newman's Own to urge lawmakers to find a solution. Robert and Ann Sacks run Fetch Eyewear in Portland, Oregon, and donate the proceeds to their nonprofit animal shelter, Pixie Project. The couple has appealed to Ron Wyden , Democratic U.S. senator from Oregon. 
""The spirit is the same,"" Ann Sacks said. ""That got us involved with the Newman's Foundation to change the private foundation tax law."" 
The company had a five-year grace period after Newman's death to comply with the law. Once that was over, executives requested and received an additional five-year extension to come up with a solution. 
Now, time is almost expired. The deadline is in November, and executives say they must make a decision on the fate of the company by the end of the first quarter to meet it. 
The law does not allow any more extensions.

6360,"Launch of bitcoin futures dragged down prices, Fed paper shows","Bitcoin's decline following a climb to nearly $20,000 was directly tied to the launch of a futures market, according to research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve published
Monday.
""The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,"" four researchers wrote in the regional Fed bank's most recent Economic Letter . ""It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.""
Peak bitcoin prices lined up with the day the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , or CME, introduced bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 17. That same day, bitcoin hit a high of $19,783, according to data from CoinDesk. The Chicago Board Options exchange, or CBOE, also opened a futures market a week earlier but trading there was thin, the letter said.
Bitcoin's 12-month performance
Source: CoinDesk
Until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of bitcoin prices, the researchers said. As o ptimistic investors continued to bid up, the cryptocurrency rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017.
The pessimists meanwhile, had no financial way to back a belief that the bitcoin price would collapse.
""So they were left to wait for their 'I told you so' moment,"" the researchers said. ""The launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.""
As of Monday, bitcoin was trading at about half of its pre-futures peak, near $9,365 as of 3:10 p.m. ET, according to CoinDesk.
The researchers compared this price reaction to mortgage-backed securities, which they said hinged on the same driving force of optimistic and pessimistic traders.
As for why it was a gradual fall rather than an overnight collapse, researchers said it could be a lack of attention or willingness to enter the market on the first week of trading.
Future prices and demand could be helped by any traditional financial institutions becoming more willing to accept bitcoin, and official recognition and regulatory acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payments, they wrote.
But a competing cryptocurrency becoming more widely used could cause bitcoin to ""drop precipitously because these tend to be winner-takes-all markets,"" researchers said.",2018-05-07T22:30:00.000+03:00
3993,"Two stocks are racing ahead of the market, and that’s got one technician worried","Amazon and Netflix live in a different reality from the rest of the market. As the S&P 500 clawed back from February sell-offs, the two have already hit a handful of new record highs. 
And that move has one widely followed technician on watch. 
""Both Amazon and Netflix are making new highs whereas a lot of other indexes aren't,"" Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Thursday. ""When we've seen this kind of narrow market breadth, it's not really a healthy sign for the overall market. We want to see a lot of companies participating. … That worries us."" 
Amazon has made 12 new all-time highs since markets hit records on Jan. 26, while Netflix has scored seven. Meanwhile, just one-tenth of the Dow has recovered to see those January highs again and only a fifth of the S&P 500. 
Netflix is the best performer on the S&P 500 in the year to date, and it beats the other components by a wide mark. The online streaming service's 70 percent gain in 2018 is far better than the 58 percent gain in XL Group , the second-best performer. The Consumer Discretionary XLY ETF, the fund that houses Netflix, has increased just 7 percent. 
Amazon's year-to-date increase tells a similar story. The e-commerce company has risen 34 percent so far this year, putting it on track for its fourth positive year in a row. Amazon is the second-best performer in the XLY ETF and the fifth-best on the S&P 500. 
Amazon's breakneck gains trouble Michael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors. He sees its current price as overvalued. 
""It does not play by the rules of traditional stock earnings and P-E ratios,"" Bapis said during the same ""Trading Nation"" appearance on Thursday. ""It's hard to buy companies trading at 250-plus times earnings that have run up so much."" 
Amazon currently trades at 155 times forward earnings and 255 times earnings over the past 12 months, while Netflix trades at 108 times forward earnings. Both companies have a price-to-earnings ratio well above the S&P 500's 17 times forward earnings. 
""To me, it looks like 2000, 2001, when these companies were getting so high-priced and there was such a craze around them,"" added Bapis. ""They've driven the markets for two-and-a-half, three years so you've got to see a pullback."" 
The information technology and consumer discretionary sectors are the two best performers on the S&P 500 in 2018 with gains of 11 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Both are ahead of the S&P 500's 3.8 percent increase. The two sectors are on track for a 10th positive year in a row. 
On the market as a whole, Johnson expects to see this slow crawl back to records for the S&P 500 and Dow but will keep a close eye on the divergence between companies such as Amazon and Netflix and broader markets. 
""We're still going to be in this kind of backing and filling until we see the breadth of this market really starting to ride out,"" he said. The narrow market breadth is ""something I really want to watch carefully in coming weeks and months.""",2018-03-09T21:10:00.000+02:00
4887,UPDATE 3-Venezuela arrests two Chevron executives amid oil purge,"Renewable Energy Venezuela arrests two Chevron executives amid oil purge Chevron said two of its executives were arrested in Venezuela, a rare move likely to spook foreign energy firms still operating in the OPEC nation stricken by hyperinflation, shortages and crime. Venezuelan Sebin intelligence agents burst into the Petropiar joint venture's office in the coastal city of Puerto La Cruz on Monday and arrested the two Venezuelan employees for alleged wrongdoing. The arrests highlight risks for foreign firms in Venezuela. Some insiders say a fracturing ruling elite is using the purge to wage turf wars or settle scores. Published 7 Hours Ago Brent Lewin | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Chevron logo is shown at Chevron Plaza in Calgary, Alberta. 
Chevron said on Tuesday two of its executives were arrested in Venezuela , a rare move likely to spook foreign energy firms still operating in the OPEC nation stricken by hyperinflation, shortages and crime. 
Venezuelan Sebin intelligence agents burst into the Petropiar joint venture's office in the coastal city of Puerto La Cruz on Monday and arrested the two Venezuelan employees for alleged wrongdoing, a half-dozen sources with knowledge of the detentions told Reuters. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry and state-run company PDVSA did not respond to information requests about the detentions, which come amid a crackdown on alleged graft in the oil sector. 
One of the detainees, Carlos Algarra, is a Venezuelan chemical engineer and expert in oil upgrading whom Chevron had brought in from its Argentina operations. The other, Rene Vasquez, is a procurement adviser, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
The U.S. major confirmed the arrests, which are believed to be the first to affect a foreign oil company's direct employees. 
""Chevron Global Technology Services Company is aware that two of its Venezuelan-based employees have been arrested by local authorities,"" Chevron said in a statement. 
""We have contacted the local authorities to understand the basis of the detention and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these employees. Our legal team is evaluating the situation and working towards the timely release of these employees."" 
A Chevron spokeswoman declined to provide further details on the case or the status of its operations. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The executives were arrested after disagreements with their PDVSA counterparts over procurement processes, two of the sources said. 
The arrests highlight risks for foreign firms in Venezuela. Some insiders say a fracturing ruling elite is using the purge to wage turf wars or settle scores. 
""Oil industry companies would do well to be cautious and stop assuming that good relations with PDVSA can last forever due to a common interest in pumping oil,"" said Raul Gallegos, associate director with the consultancy Control Risks. 
""The level of corruption in PDVSA, especially under a military administration, can and will trump production logic."" 
President Nicolas Maduro since last year has overseen the arrest of dozens of oil executives, including the former energy minister and PDVSA president. 
The purge comes years after industry analysts began criticizing PDVSA for widespread graft. The government long decried such accusations as ""smear campaigns,"" but last year Maduro started blaming ""thieves"" for rampant graft in the oil sector. 
Vowing a cleanup, many jailed executives have been replaced with soldiers, but PDVSA's unpopular management has spurred a wave of resignations. Related Securities",2018-04-18T16:13:00.000+03:00
1076,Apple skeptic says company ‘in trouble’ ahead of HomePod launch,"show chapters Trading Nation: Apple nears $1 trillion market cap 3:33 PM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 | 02:20 Apple has lost some of its bite, one strategist says.
Fiercer competition and an inflated belief in its own products are among some of the challenges facing the world's largest company, according to BK Asset Management's Boris Schlossberg .
""I do think they're in trouble. I think they're making a huge mistake,"" Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Tuesday. ""They're basically betting on the fact that high expensive products can be sold at this point and it's clearly becoming evident that everybody has caught up to them in the marketplace.""
Schlossberg's concerns over Apple pricing resurfaced ahead of the launch of its Siri-connected artificial-intelligence home device, the HomePod. With a $349 price tag, its latest product is far more expensive than its major competitors, including Amazon's Alexa-equipped Echo or Google's Home Mini.
""Nobody is going to buy it at the price that they're putting it out right now because the functionality of those products is just nowhere near as great as it needs to be relative to the price difference,"" said Schlossberg.
Worries over softening iPhone sales have also spread among a number of analyst firms. J.P. Morgan estimates a 50 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in sales of its high-end iPhone X, while Atlantic Equities downgraded its rating to neutral from overweight on signs of weaker iPhone demand.
Max Wolff , chief economist at The Phoenix Group, is cognizant of weaker iPhone sales trends but does not expect those issues to come into focus as soon as this quarter. Instead, he sees Apple still in a position of strength.
""They command a high price. They're sitting on a ton of cash. The tax breaks help them,"" he said. ""I don't think they're a bad bet for the next couple of quarters, certainly not this one, but there are some storm clouds on the horizon for sure.""
Analysts generally expect an upbeat quarter for Apple with quarterly adjusted earnings and sales both rising by 11 percent. Sales of the iPhone, the best-selling Apple product and its largest topline contributor, are forecast to climb by 10 percent. Apple has come in above analysts' consensus in the past six quarters. The company is due to report its fiscal first quarter on Feb. 1.
Reports of weaker iPhone demand have roiled Apple's stock price this week. Since Monday, shares have dropped 2 percent and are on track for their first negative weekly performance of the year. Its stock is up around 3 percent since the beginning of 2018, roughly half the S&P 500 's year-to-date gains and is one of the worst performers in the technology sector. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF has risen 7 percent in January.
Even so, Apple shares remain in a solid position after closing out 2017 with its best annual gains since 2010, the year it launched the iPad. Shares are nearly 3 percent from an all-time intraday high set on Jan. 18.

""That's not the case. If that was the case, I wouldn't be talking about it anyway,"" Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick in an interview that aired Friday on "" Squawk Box .""
Unsubstantiated reports in March that some big investors were beginning to analyze buying all or part of GE sent the company's shares higher. Some speculated that Buffett was looking to invest, with RBC Capital Markets theorizing that GE's downtrodden state makes it ripe for him to invest.
""Berkshire Hathaway has a history of investing in storied businesses struggling at steep valuation dislocations,"" analyst Deane Dray wrote in a note to clients at the time. ""In many ways, GE's current situation fits the profile of an ideal Warren Buffett investment.""
Dray also noted Buffett's Berkshire invested in GE's preferred shares during the financial crisis in October 2008.

""I admire John Flannery and what he's doing. He's got a very tough job and he's doing it very logically,"" Buffett said. ""It's a terrific American company from way, way, way back.""
Shares of GE were 0.25 percent higher in trading Friday. The stock has fallen more than 52 percent over the last 12 months, to $13.93 as of Friday's open.
GE reported upbeat earnings in its first-quarter report last month and reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year. The company's GE Capital and power businesses continue to drag on its performance but overall the report offered relief for GE after a tumultuous 12 months.
Investors have been selling GE stock amid questions about the company's ability to grow in the future. Flannery is in the midst of an extensive restructuring of the business, which could result in the sale or spinoff of parts of its portfolio. At the same time, the company has set aside reserves for potential liabilities at its GE Capital unit, which is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Justice.

1016,How technology is helping transform BMW's business model,"German auto giant BMW can trace its roots all the way back to 1916. A lot has changed in the industry since then, of course, but the importance of innovation has remained a constant.
While technological advances such as autonomous driving may be changing BMW vehicles, the company's business model is also being reshaped.
""In the past we had quite a vertical integration,"" Jens Monsees, BMW Group's vice president of strategy digitalization, told CNBC. This revolved around the customer, the dealer, then a producer like BMW and tier one suppliers who provided parts. This value chain, Monsees said, was now becoming a more horizontal network with other partners involved. 
As digital technology becomes increasingly advanced and ubiquitous, and devices become more integrated and interdependent, collaboration is becoming more important.
Monsees cited the example of BMW, Daimler and Audi acquiring digital mapping and location services business HERE. That deal was announced in 2015; at the time, BMW described HERE as a ""leading provider of technology"" for the digitized world of mobility.
HERE offered services that the business needed for both autonomous driving and location-based services, Monsees told CNBC. Data, such as where exactly windscreen wipers are being used, is entered into the system and shared. ""Why not (share with)… Audi or Daimler this data, because we don't want car accidents, whatever the competition,"" he said.
Monsees sought to emphasize the bigger picture when it comes to sharing information, citing examples from the U.S.
""We can learn from... (Silicon) Valley that… Google and Apple and maybe Amazon, they are competing on one hand… On the other side, they are helping and supporting each other in a bigger sense."" This, Monsees said, was a ""frienemy"" concept, where an Apple phone could have Google Maps and vice versa.
Technology was also transforming BMW's production processes, he said. ""We use, more and more, technology and robots to support our people and employees in the factories to do heavy lifting, to sort out things, to transport things.""

1275,US auto sales are expected to be up slightly in January: JD Power and LMC,"U.S. auto sales in January likely rose 0.8 percent from the same month in 2017 as automakers continued offering high consumer discounts to sell vehicles, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Monday.
""The challenge (for automakers) in 2018 will be maintaining incentive discipline, coming off a year when incentive spending per unit reached the highest level ever recorded,"" Thomas King, senior vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Power,  
January U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.153 million units, an increase of around 0.8 percent from 1.141 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 16 selling days of January. Automakers will release U.S. sales results for the month on Feb. 1.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million units after hitting a record high in 2016 and are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars come back to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
LMC said it expects full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales to hit 17 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for January will be 17.1 million vehicles, down nearly 2 percent from 17.4 million units in the same month in 2017, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include multiple, lower-margin fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to rise a little over 1 percent in November.
The average discount per vehicle in January hit $3,733, an all-time record for the month.
Discounts hit 10 percent of the manufacturer's recommended sales prices. Experts believe that anything above 10 percent hurts vehicle resale values and is ultimately unhealthy for the industry.
The consultancies noted that discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 18 of the last 19 months.",2018-01-29T16:43:00.000+02:00
3798,"Cash is back as an asset because of rising US bond yields, strategist says","The rising yields on U.S. bonds have started a new trend: holding cash, a market strategist told CNBC on Friday.
U.S Treasurys have seen yields rising since the start of the year on fears that inflation will creep up at a faster-than-expected pace, and the Federal Reserve will therefore be forced to increase interest rates more often than what markets expect. Last month, for example, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a four-year high trading closely to 3 percent.
""We have actually got this slightly healthier situation, I think, in terms of U.S. bond market, where yields have gotten back up,"" Roger Jones, head of equities at London and Capital, told CNBC Friday.
He also noted that at the same time, many investors are expecting returns on bonds to be lower going forward, ""so you're actually getting some return in cash.""
If market players believe that yields are going to increase meaningfully, then they will avoid investing in bonds, because the risk on what's usually perceived as a less-risky investment grows significantly. In such situation, it is preferable to hold cash rather than invest into bonds and lose money.
""So cash actually becomes an asset,"" Jones said.
Konstantin Postumitenko | Getty Images Creating a ""financial freedom"" plan can put you on the path toward the life of your dreams. Alexander Aldinger, interest rate strategist at Bayernlb, told CNBC via email that the bank expects higher U.S. Treasury yields throughout the year.
""We expect 10 year U.S. Treasury yields to move sideways in a range between 2.7 percent and 3 percent for the remainder of the first quarter and in most of the second quarter,"" he said, pointing out that ""in the second half of this year, with higher inflation rates, we see 10 year U.S. yields to climb above 3 percent and to remain above this important mark.""
The 3 percent level on U.S. Treasury yields is often mentioned as a potentially dangerous moment for markets, with equities set to fall sharply. Higher yields mean higher borrowing costs for firms and thus a risk for their margins.
""We've got to start being mindful where risks are, looking at risk-adjusted returns, and then start to taper off some of that risk,"" Jones warned.",2018-03-09T15:17:00.000+02:00

(Updates with European trading, changes byline/dateline) PARIS/SYDNEY, April 9 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat futures rose on Monday to a three-week high as cold weather threatened to stress U.S. wheat already weakened over a U.S.-Chinese trade dispute. Corn was marginally higher. The U.S. government last Monday gave its lowest rating for winter wheat for the time of year since 2002, following drought in the U.S. Plains, and some crops have since endured a cold spell. ""There are concerns about cold temperatures causing some frost damage, coming after last week's U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report that showed the damage of recent dry weather,"" National Australia Bank agribusiness economist Phin Ziebell said. Freezing conditions since late last week could also delay planting of the country's spring crop, which the government has expected to gain extra acreage this year. The weather represented ""heightened risks to U.S. winter wheat yield and spring wheat planting,"" Thomson Reuters Agriculture Research analysts said, adding that little moisture was expected for crops up to mid-April. The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 1.1 percent at $4.77-1/2 a bushel by 1050 GMT. The contract earlier rose as high as $4.81-3/4, a level last reached on March 16, adding to its 1.6 percent gain from Friday. The most active CBOT soybean futures were up 1.2 percent at $10.46 a bushel, while the most active corn contract inched 0.3 percent higher to $3.89-1/2 a bushel. Escalating tensions between the United States and China have triggered U.S. soybean purchases by European buyers, after Chinese demand sent Brazilian prices surging. Investors took heart from comments by U.S. government officials playing down the threat of a trade war with China, despite tit-for-tat tariff proposals in the past week. The inclusion of soybeans by China, the world's biggest importer of the oilseed, on a list of U.S. goods that could be subject to retaliatory duties, sent soybean futures plunging last Wednesday. Corn prices were more subdued, with traders awaiting news on President Donald Trump's policy on biofuel, a major outlet for U.S. corn. Grain markets were also looking ahead to Tuesday's monthly supply and demand forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that could bring revisions to projected South American corn and soybean output, along with adjustments to the U.S. balance sheet.

3342,Why NBA star Chris Paul owns his own professional bowling team,"4 Hours Ago | 01:27 
Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul is known for scoring major success on the basketball court: He's racked up career achievements like being a nine-time All Star and being ranked third in NBA history with a career average of 9.9 assists per game. Forbes even ranked him the ninth highest paid basketball player in 2017. 
But the athlete also plays another surprising sport: bowling. Paul calls the game his "" other passion ."" 
He even owns a professional bowling team. Jesse Grant | Getty Images Chris Paul 
In 2012 , Paul founded L.A.X. , a Los Angeles team in the Professional Bowlers Association's PBA League. The team consists of five players , including PBA champion Jason Belmonte , who currently holds 17 titles. Imeh Akpanudosen | Getty Images Jason Belmonte with Chris Paul 
So why Paul's love for pins, strikes and spares? The 32-year-old says he got it from his parents, especially his dad. Paul fondly remembers his childhood in North Carolina spent at the bowling alley. 
""My dad was a part of a bowling league, so me and my brother would sit in these smoky bowling alleys, getting the best french fries you've ever had in your life,"" Paul tells CNBC Make It about himself and his sibling C.J. Paul . Jason LaVeris | Getty Images Chris Paul (right) with his brother C.J. and mom Robin 
""As I got older, I think it was my senior year in high school and my brother's sophomore year in college, my parents got us bowling balls for Christmas,"" he adds. 
""We were so excited. My bowling ball was red, white and blue. It looked like the old ABA style basketball. And my brother's was brown, and it had the number 23 on it and Michael Jordan's signature,"" he recalls. 
Since joining the NBA, Paul has been able to meet who he calls ""great"" bowlers like Norm Duke and Pete Weber . Besides owning a bowling team, Paul has been hosting a popular annual charity bowling tournament , which draws other athletes like Rockets player James Harden and former NFL star Terrell Owens to the lanes. For two consecutive years, Paul has won the doubles title in the celebrity invitational. Juan Ocampo | Getty Images C.J. Anderson, Mookie Betts, Miles Brown, Austin Rivers, D.J. Khaled, Terrell Owens, Chris Paul, Luc Mbah a Moute and J.T. Jackson at the State Farm CP3 PBA Celebrity Invitational hosted by Paul in January 17, 2017 
Proceeds from the tournament benefit Paul's non-profit, the Chris Paul Family Foundation , which ""strives to positively impact individuals and families by leveling the playing field in education, sports and life."" Recently, the foundation held a prom dress giveaway, and annually gives two scholarships to his alma mater, Wake Forest University, to students from Forsyth Country, North Carolina. 
It's no secret that Paul is a star on the basketball court (other career highlights include winning gold medals with Team USA at the 2008 and 2012 summer Olympic Games). But with bowling, he's still got goals. 
""I've never thrown a 300,"" Paul says, referring to the score for a perfect game. ""The highest I've ever bowled is a 256. 
""I couldn't imagine being in the 10th frame with 11 strikes thrown and getting up there to throw the 12th strike,"" he says. ""I've never had that feeling. Would like that feeling, but I would much rather have to throw a free throw than have to throw that strike,"" says Paul. 
""If I bowl a 300,"" adds Paul, ""everyone's going to know about it."" 
And bowling, Paul says, does have one benefit basketball doesn't: longevity. 
""I [have] a 79-year-old great uncle who still bowls like three, four days a week,"" Paul says. ""Basketball? Not so much. I'm not going to be hoopin' when I'm 79 years old, you can cancel that."" show chapters ",2018-03-28T17:41:00.000+03:00

It was 2014, and the family was living in the U.S., Goldin having worked as beauty brand Revlon’s global CMO based out of New York.
Everyone has their Lego story, says Goldin. “Every time I meet anybody and I tell them that I work at Lego, I get a big smile because everybody has a personal story to tell. They remember their first set, they remember the first time they gave (it) to their child (or) something that they built.” “Marketing is really core to what we put out there … and that’s why we want it to be part of the results presentation.” Julia Goldin - Chief Marketing Officer, Lego
But Goldin’s Lego story isn’t one from her childhood. She grew up in Russia, a world without the famous plastic bricks (Lego as we know it today was first made in a small Danish town in 1958), and it wasn’t until she relocated to the U.S. as a mother to a four-year-old son that she fell in love with Lego. A move to Japan followed when he was six, but the bricks weren’t well-known there either.
“In Japan at that time, you didn't have much Lego. So I used to go back to London to shop in Argos. And one of the sets that I bought for him, because he really wanted it, was the Millennium Falcon (a starship in the “Star Wars” franchise), (so) that's my Lego story.” The world’s most valuable toy brand

There have been various versions of the Millennium Falcon and the latest, launched in October, was one of Lego’s hits of 2017. Selling for nearly $800, it has 7,500 pieces, making it the largest version of the spaceship the company has created. But it was an abundance of bricks that contributed to last year’s poor results: Too much stock was held in warehouses in 2016 and had to be sold off cheaply, contributing to an 8 percent decline in revenues for 2017. Lego’s 2017 Millennium Falcon is one of its largest models.
Speaking at its results presentation in March, CEO Niels. B Christiansen said there would be “ no quick fix ” for the company and that more efficient marketing would be one priority for 2018. Goldin plans to make sure there are fewer hierarchies in her teams so that decisions can be made more quickly, and will also focus on data analytics to measure the impact of campaigns.
Goldin spoke for 20 minutes at its March results day and while it is unusual to see a CMO make a presentation at such events, she says marketing is a central part of how the privately-owned business operates, so Lego’s success depends on it.
“In many companies, the chief marketing officer is only the marketing. I don't just do marketing. You know that's actually only one small portion of the job. What my team does is the whole product portfolio, product experience, communication, content, social channels. So it's really core to what we put out there in the market place and that's why we want it to be part of the presentation,” she explained to CNBC via phone.
T he name Lego comes from “Leg godt,” a Danish phrase meaning “play well.” Founder Ole Kirk Kristiansen started making wooden toys in his workshop in Billund, Denmark in 1932, selling them as Lego toys from 1934. The Kristiansen family still owns 75 percent of the business via holding company Kirkbi, and the group made a net profit of 7.8 billion Danish crowns ($1.29 billion) in 2017.
The entire Lego brand as it’s known today was built on a simple foundation 60 years ago: one, small, plastic brick, 31.8mm long by 15.8mm wide, with eight studs in two rows of four. By the 1960s, Europe was seeing mass relocation from rural areas to towns and the toy sets started to reflect society’s increasing urbanization: One of the first Lego sets was a town plan that helped children learn about road safety.
There are now more than 3,700 different types of pieces, from mini figures to tubes and accessories such as wheels and swords and more than 900 million building combinations are possible with just six bricks of the same color.
Bricks are made at Lego’s Billund factory, where there are 12 manufacturing modules. Within those are 65 molding machines, all creating millions of pieces, and the factory is run autonomously. Fans of the brand can do a two-day Lego Inside tour of the factory and Kristiansen’s original house, as well as build with its designers, for 14,500 Danish crowns ($2,396). “Lego is a very mission-driven company. The family is very clear about the mission to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow, to reach more kids, and they're super dedicated to that” Julia Goldin - Chief Marketing Officer, Lego
Today, the company’s mission is “to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow,” a phrase often repeated by Christiansen and Goldin.
“Lego is a very mission-driven company. The family is very clear about the mission to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow, to reach more kids, and they're super dedicated to that,” Goldin told CNBC by phone. But it’s not just about selling more bricks to more kids: the company says that playing with Lego is about education as well as creativity.
“It’s about problem solving. It’s about collaboration. It's about acquiring skills that will help them to be stronger and more successful in the world … We believe that we have a massive role to play in the lives of children in terms of their development,” Goldin stated at its results presentation. The firm also has a foundation that promotes early childhood education.
Lego’s Vice President of Digital Consumer Engagement Peter Kim, who spoke at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London in March, said this mission creates a strong internal culture, as well as an external message. “The culture is quite strong. Anyone can tell you what the mission and vision are. We have a goal to reach 300 million children by 2032: these are the things that people who come to (work at Lego) understand and know,” he said.
Being a private company also helps. “We can really kind of stick to (the mission), even when times are not so good, and when times are good, it gives us a north star to focus on,” Kim stated. Lego for grown-ups
Lego has almost a million adults in its Lego Ideas online community, and each year the company launches four products based on the designs. First, they have to have least 10,000 votes from supporters before being put to a panel of Lego experts.
In 2017, journalist Maia Weinstock’s “Women of NASA” idea made it through and it became a top-selling product on Amazon within 24 hours of launch. Others include spaceship NASA Apollo Saturn V, the rocket that launched astronauts to the moon in 1969, and a Lego “Tron: Legacy” set, which launched at the end of March. Winners get a 1 percent cut of sales plus licensing revenue.
D iversification is an important strategy for Lego, but it’s one that threatened the company in the early 2000s. In 1998, the toymaker faced the first deficit in its history and the following year it decided to cut 1,000 jobs. By 2003, net sales fell by 26 percent, play material sales slipped 29 percent and as a result, the pre-tax loss on earnings came in at 1.4 billion Danish crowns ($211.7 million). In 2004, it appointed a new CEO and a plan to focus back on its traditional values and products.
Since then, it has gone beyond the brick, creating an array of movies (“The Lego Movie,” “Lego Star Wars,” “Batman,” and its own story, “Lego Ninjago”) and video games, plus its YouTube channel — the site’s most popular branded channel — with 5 million subscribers, plus countless fan sites.
“Beyond The Brick” is one such YouTube channel, with more than 280,000 subscribers and over 120 million views. Brothers Joshua (22) and John Hanlon (24) started it in 2011 and made it their full-time job last May. “Regardless of age or ability, anyone can pick up Lego pieces and let their imagination run wild” John Hanlon, founder of ‘Beyond the Brick’
Such user-generated content is obviously valuable to Lego — the Hanlon brothers were invited to its Denmark headquarters twice in 2017 — but also to content creators. In an email to CNBC, John Hanlon said that they expect to make a six-figure sum in 2018, with around 90 percent coming from YouTube’s ad system and the rest from pre-roll ads they sell to companies such as Sprint. The brothers spend about half the year traveling around the world to make Lego YouTube videos.
Why do they love it so much? “Regardless of age or ability, anyone can pick up Lego pieces and let their imagination run wild,” John Hanlon told CNBC by email. “Lego brings together the young and old for wholesome, non-electronic fun.”
Adult fans of Lego (known as AFOL) are also an important audience for the company. Last August, TV show “Lego Masters” ran on the U.K.’s Channel 4, a contest to find Britain’s best Lego builders, attracting more than 2 million viewers per episode, Goldin says. People not only got on Twitter to comment, they also shopped: “People went into stores and wanted to buy and wanted to build,” she said at its results presentation.
Lego’s Architecture range is popular with adult fans, who build city skylines and buildings such as the U.S. Capitol or New York’s Guggenheim Museum. Berliner Arndt Schlaudraff makes his own versions of iconic structures, using all-white Lego Architecture Studio pieces. His creations include the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi and the Synagogue of Livorno in Italy.

While Lego has opened itself up to external fans and creators, its policy when working with other corporates is to be protective of its brand, such as Warner Brothers on the “Lego Batman” movie and Disney on the “Star Wars” films.
“We make sure that everything that we do is very true to the values of our brand and bring that brand to life in a way that we protect as much as possible,” Goldin told CNBC by phone. “With Warner Brothers, the secret sauce is the fact that we each allow each other to do what we are really best at.” Lego brings its designers to create characters, while it lets Warner get on with the animation.
Lego also wants to immerse people in its real-life worlds, and along with its eight Legoland theme parks (operated by Merlin Entertainments, of which the Kristiansen family owns 29.7 percent), it opened the Lego House in Denmark last September, a playground full of 25 million bricks. It’s made up of multiple-colored zones that aim to teach “core competencies” to children, including social development, problem solving, emotional development and creativity.
There’s a brick play pit, a waterfall of bricks and a giant tree of creativity, many floors high. Guests can build a fish out of Lego, take it to a scanning station, add eyes and other features before it appears as a digital version in a giant fish tank, where it experiences various emotions.
The connection between the physical and digital worlds is something Goldin is asked a lot about, she says.
“One of the big questions that I'm always asked is the question of digitalization — is that a threat to Lego (or) is that an opportunity. We believe digitalization is a massive opportunity … Technology has been part of integration into Lego experience for a long time now,” she stated at its results presentation in March, and pointed out that Mindstorms, its range of programmable robots, is now 20-years-old. “The nature of play has also evolved with the rise of digital. Competition comes in many forms, not just products but how kids decide to spend their time and how lifestyles have changed” Peter Kim, Vice President of Digital Consumer Engagement, Lego
Its Lego Life online community for children has 6 million members, where the most popular thing for kids to do is upload pictures of their own creations. Meanwhile Lego Boost, launched last August, lets children as young as seven attach their Lego toy to sensors so they can be programmed to respond to movement and even talk.
And as well as contending with obvious rivals such as Hasbro or Mattel, Lego is also competing with how children and their parents choose to live, says Kim. “The nature of play has also evolved with the rise of digital. Competition comes in many forms, not just products but how kids decide to spend their time and how lifestyles have changed,” he said, speaking at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London last month.
“Maybe it’s a matter of competing for attention with YouTube influencers as much as (wondering) is there time to build a (Lego) set? So the trick is, how do we get within that stream and really create collaborations to make play part of life.”
I s Lego succumbing to that threat from evolving lifestyles? The company’s 8 percent decline in revenue for 2017 was the first time it had seen a fall since 2004 but CEO Christiansen hopes this will be a better year. “We are going to start off 18 on a better note than the way we started 17,” he said at its results presentation in March.
In spite of its disappointing results, Goldin maintains that Lego was still high on children’s holiday wish lists for 2017. “Despite the challenging year that we had, at the end of the year we saw more kids put us on their wish lists in key markets like the U.S. and Germany. And that gives us a lot of confidence about the fact that Lego is still very relevant and very engaging to them,” she said at the presentation.
For brand consultant Stephen Cheliotis, Lego is loved by all types of people. It topped the Superbrands ranking of the U.K.’s strongest consumer brands, an organization Chelotis chairs. “One obvious reason is first of all that it doesn't really polarize opinion … It's a brand that isn't seen to be ‘oh yeah that was great way back then.’ It's still seen (by people) as still applicable, useful and relevant to me today.”
One thing the company has changed is the speed at which it works, giving its teams “more power to make decisions, to act quicker and to be more creative,” according to Christiansen. That has extended to its in-house creative agency, headed by creative director Emma Perkins.
Traditionally, agencies work out an insight about a particular product, sometimes the result of research with consumers, before teams are briefed to create an idea or advert that reflects that insight. Sometimes weeks later, ideas are presented to creative directors and eventually clients.
“Lego have completely taken apart what it is to be an agency and how to have ideas, so the speed of which we need to go out there … this idea of waiting for an insight, developing an insight, handing it off to a (strategic) planner … that’s all been taken apart at Lego,” Perkins said, addressing an audience at Advertising Week Europe last month. Instead, the company now uses a sprint methodology developed by Google Ventures, where people from different departments clear their diaries for a week to work on one task, to prototype a communication idea. Senior Lego staff get to see ideas quickly, and feedback happens fast. “It would be easy to be arrogant and just say that everyone knows the brand … but it’s always, hey, what do consumers want, how do we get there?” Peter Kim, Vice President of Digital Consumer Engagement, Lego
The process for creating online content is also a focus for Goldin, with teams working on new content as a product launches, rather than doing so far ahead. “We allow our people to have much more flexibility in terms of making decisions … And making changes that they need to, less hierarchies and less processes, but also making sure that they free up their time (so they don't just) create many things ahead of time,"" she told CNBC by phone.
Along with changing how it operates to be fit for the future, Lego is also looking to new markets. Lego saw “strong double-digit growth” in China and will open an office in Dubai this year. “In places like China and India as we expand our geographic reach, people actually don’t know Lego at all, so we still can learn what it means and build up that muscle to be a challenger brand and to learn what it means to have competition and fight copycat … It’s a matter of staying humble,” Kim said, speaking at Advertising Week Europe. Lego announced a partnership with Tencent in January, which will see Lego games offered by the Chinese internet giant, as well as an extension of Lego Life in China.
Newer entrants are also coming into the market all the time, such as GoldieBlox, a toy company encouraging girls to build and aiming to inspire careers in the science and technology industries. “It would be easy to be arrogant and just say that everyone knows the brand, and we just keep doing what we’re doing and we’re good, but it’s always, hey, what do consumers want, how do we get there, how do we deliver?” Kim said.
Finding out what children and their parents want is the secret to Lego’s success. According to Goldin, the answer is novelty: each year, 25 percent to 30 percent of sales come from new products. “As a chief marketing officer you really need to understand how the whole process works, how you can accelerate it, how you can bring things to market faster, how you problem solve around it, but also how you inspire innovation,” Goldin told CNBC. And it is here that her experience selling cosmetics to women at Revlon helps her.
“Like in the toy business, the beauty category depends a lot on novelty … Like kids, women don’t know what they want … No woman would ever tell you what it is that she really wants. No woman would ever tell you that she has enough pairs of shoes or enough colors of lipsticks or enough makeup. But if you ask them what is it that you want, they will never know. And it's the same with the kids, they're looking for novelty.” Credits:",2018-04-27T08:13:00.000+03:00
6413,Indigo Agriculture CEO wants to change economics for farmers with a 'revolution in agriculture',"As consumers grow increasingly health-conscious and chemical-averse, companies like Indigo Agriculture are working to weed out old, synthetic agricultural solutions like GMOs, Indigo CEO David Perry told CNBC on Thursday.
""Modern agriculture's really built on technologies that were created decades ago: synthetic fertilizer, synthetic chemicals, GMOs and plant breeding. We're taking an entirely new approach,"" Perry told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview.
""I think this is an opportunity to see a revolution in agriculture using naturally discovered microbes to improve yields of plants and also to protect them against pests and insects so we can reduce the amount of fertilizer used and the amount of agricultural chemicals used,"" Perry said Thursday.
Meet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies A tech entrepreneur who grew up on his family's farm in Arkansas, Perry joined Indigo as CEO in 2015, one year after the science, machine-learning and agricultural hybrid start-up was founded.
The company studies what Perry has called ""survivor"" plants — plants that have managed to grow in strained environmental conditions — and compiles their genetic and microbial information into a massive database.
Indigo then uses machine learning to search the database and find microbes that could help specific plants survive in less-than-ideal conditions.

""We're seeing 10 to 15 percent yield gains,"" Perry told Cramer. ""The average farmer makes less than 10 percent margin, so if you ... increase their yield by 10 or 15 percent, you're doubling their profitability, so it's a significant impact.""
Besides healthier, more naturally sourced food, farmers are at the heart of Indigo's mission.
By giving farmers the opportunity to produce higher quality crops, Indigo is fundamentally changing how crops like corn and wheat — typically viewed as commodities — are valued by the market.
A look back at the CNBC Disruptor 50: 6 years, 167 companies ""One of the problems with the existing system is that most farmers take their output and put it into silos or collection points with all their neighbors,"" Perry explained. ""And in that system, it's impossible to get paid for growing things with higher quality or growing things more sustainably.""
Perry then highlighted a key part of Indigo's mission: connecting farmers directly with buyers and coordinating transaction logistics, which serves to ""preserve the identity"" of the farmers' output until it reaches the consumer.
""It's the only way to fundamentally change the economics for the farmer. As long as they're producing a commodity, they're going to be competing with low-cost producers all over the world,"" the CEO said. ""But if we start allowing them to differentiate their products, make them value-added based on quality and sustainability; better for the farmer, better for the consumer.""

1981,Five areas where filers are likely to cheat on their taxes,"If you've thought about squirreling away cash from your side gig and hiding it from the Internal Revenue Service, you are not alone.
A recent study by Credit Karma Tax showed that 6 percent of about 2,000 people polled 'fessed up to fibbing on their taxes.
""We found that most Americans really want to pay the right amount of tax,"" said Rick Chen, a spokesman for Credit Karma Tax. ""They're focused on paying their fair share.""
There's a price to pay for trying to get around the IRS.
""Not reporting your income, or tweaking your income so that you fall below a certain threshold to take advantage of a tax credit, is against the law,"" said Chen.
Common fees levied by the IRS include failure to file, which carries a penalty of 5 percent of the unpaid tax, and failure to pay, which has a penalty of 0.5 percent of the tax not paid by the due date.
In more egregious cases, however, individuals who evade their taxes may be found guilty of a felony and face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
Here are the areas where filers have admitted to being less than honest with the IRS, according to Credit Karma Tax.

4297,This map shows where people are suffering financially from student debt,"Pamela Joe McFarlane | Getty Images College student entering a financial aid. 
College grads from New Hampshire are probably carrying student loan debt. In 2015, 64 percent of undergraduate students hailing from the Granite State had federal student loans. 
From California? You're more likely to be debt-free. Just 1 in 5 students from the Golden State had federal student loans that year. 
A new tool from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., lets people dig into student loan information on a state — and even county — level. You can check the median student loan debt of residents in Albany County, Wyoming ($19,542), for example, or the share of student loan debt in collections in Ada Country, Idaho (3 percent). 
Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has swelled to more than $1.3 trillion. But researchers haven't put much time into understanding the geographic distribution of this burden, said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and a researcher on the map project. 
Until now. 
The Midwest and the Northeast are the regions most heavily saturated in student debt, according to The Urban Institute's calculations, with the worst states being New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine. Meanwhile, residents in New Mexico, Wyoming and California carry the least education debt. 
Unsurprisingly, students from states where college is more expensive tend to borrow more. 
The findings also assessed factors that make someone more likely to be burdened by education debt. 
""The people who struggle the most to pay back student loan debt tend to be people with lower amounts of student loans who haven't completed their degree,"" Ratcliffe said. ""So now they have the debt but no degree.""

161,"Ripple sold $91.6 million of digital currency XRP last quarter, as the price surged almost 30,000%","Ripple, the payments company that's developing a blockchain-based system for banks, sold $91.6 million worth of digital currency XRP in the fourth quarter, taking advantage of last year's 29,631 percent price surge.
Trading volume in the quarter jumped more than 35,000 percent to an average of over $807 million a day from $2.28 million in the same period a year earlier, Ripple said on Wednesday.
""XRP markets ended the year with a statement — one that will likely be remembered as a defining milestone in XRP's history,"" the company said.
For Ripple, which owns about 60 percent of all the XRP in existence, the sudden excitement for cryptocurrencies and all things blockchain has been a huge boon to the start-up's balance sheet. In total, Ripple used XRP sales to bring in over $180 million last year, without having to give up any equity in the company.
That gives Ripple a significant cash cushion as it tries to sell its software to financial institutions and provides some protection in case the price of XRP crashes.
It's been a wild ride so far to start 2018. After starting the year at $2.30, XRP quickly shot up to a high of $3.84 on Jan. 4, before tumbling below $1.12 days later. The currency currently sits at $1.35, which translates into about $81 billion worth of holdings for Ripple.
In order to control the flow of XRP into the market, Ripple put the majority of its stake — 55 billion — into an escrow account and has the flexibility to sell up to 1 billion a month. CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC , in a story published last week, that the company has no intention of maximizing its sales to pad its cash position.
In the fourth quarter, Ripple sold $71.5 million of XRP through programmatic sales and $20.1 million directly to investors. If it sold the same percentage of total volume traded through programmatic sales this quarter as last, Ripple would have already generated over $70 million through Jan. 23, using daily volume numbers tracked by CoinMarketCap .
The big test for Ripple is getting financial institutions to adopt XRP so that it's more than just a highly volatile trade.
Earlier this month, the company announced that MoneyGram is using Ripple's xRapid technology and XRP currency for cross-border payments. And in a separate announcement on Wednesday, the company said that IDT Corporation and Mercury FX will use xRapid ""to settle remittances and corporate transactions quickly.""
The idea is to eliminate the time it takes for payments to clear using a digital currency that's built for financial transactions. Here's how Mercury FX founder Alastair Constance described it in the statement.
""Digital assets promise fast transaction speeds but XRP is far faster than all of them, including bitcoin. Cutting settlement times from hours and days to just three seconds or less will remove billions of dollars in unnecessary intermediary fees.""

Hard rock fans, get ready to empty your wallets.
On June 29, Guns N' Roses will commemorate the 30 th anniversary edition of the group's landmark album, ""Appetite for Destruction"" – and it will cost a whopping $999.
In 1988, the original album topped the Billboard charts, buoyed by hit singles like ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" and ""Paradise City."" In 2017, Billboard magazine said ""Appetite for Destruction"" had sold a staggering 30 million copies worldwide , leading some to think the album deserved a reissue.In fact, it's getting a few different ones. There's a no-frills re-release of the original album and a two-disc edition with bonus tracks. More serious fans may opt for the ""Super Deluxe Edition,"" with four audio discs, a Blu-ray Disc, a hardcover book and lots of memorabilia.
But for some, that's still not enough. Enter the ""Locked N' Loaded"" $999 edition , a box set that comes in a faux leather and wood cabinet. It contains everything in the ""Super Deluxe Edition"" and lots more: The package will include numerous mementos such as logo patches, guitar picks, never-before-seen band photos and posters.
Some fans have balked at the album's huge price tag, but considering the wealth of goodies contained therein, there's an argument to be made for that price point, some music industry experts told CNBC recently. Time will tell if there's enough demand for its 10,000-unit production run, but several observers think ""Locked N' Loaded"" will have no problem finding 10,000 different places to call home.""Guns N' Roses has gobs of fans across the globe who were teens or of college age during the band's heyday,"" said Rafe Gomez, co-owner of VC Inc. Marketing.
""Many of these Guns N' Roses devotees, who are now adults, have the disposable cash to invest in the band's new release,"" he added.Armen Shaomian, a professor of entertainment at the University of South Carolina, pointed out that fans used to paying scalpers for last minute concert tickets may not even bat an eye at the set's price.
""Fans pay well over $1,000 on either secondary premium tickets or for those V.I.P. experiences that many bands offer,"" he said.The price is also justified because anyone interested in this set is thinking about more than just the music, according to Denny Somach, a Grammy-award music producer, author and rock historian.""It's no doubt a high-priced item, but this is more of an experience being purchased as opposed to just another collector's box set,"" Somach said. Consumers should get used to seeing more such high-end collector's sets. ""These kinds of products will become more commonplace as acts look to market their legacy,"" he said.For an extreme case of legacy marketing, legendary Kiss bassist Gene Simmons released a 10-disc set in 2017. The so-called vault had an option to be hand-delivered to the purchaser's home by the Kiss bassist himself for $50,000.
Guns N' Roses' album ""needs to be viewed as a one-time experience as opposed to a deluxe edition package,"" Somach added.
Anyone worried that the Geffen Records warehouse will end up a home to thousands of copies of the ""Locked N' Loaded"" set can take comfort in the fact that the band's ""Not In This Lifetime"" tour last year reaped over $300 million , according to Billboard data.
The band's enduring popularity suggests there's fertile ground for uber-fans – such as New York resident Steven Jacobson — eager to get their hands on the ultimate commemorative album, regardless of the price.
Jacobson, president of Hopkinson Real Estate, has seen the band over 200 times, met its members and owns copious amounts of rare memorabilia. He's already preordered his ""Locked N' Loaded"" copy, which he told CNBC was an opportunity that couldn't be passed up.
""This isn't about money,"" he said. ""This is an experience. The holy grail for the Guns N' Roses fan."" ",2018-05-26T18:00:00.000+03:00
4798,"75% of the ultra-rich forecast a US recession in the next two years, survey finds","GDP outlook 75% of the ultra-rich forecast a US recession in the next two years, survey finds Of those expecting an economic downturn in the U.S., a fifth of respondents — 21 percent — believe it will begin in 2019 and 50 percent expect the next recession to start in 2020. The ominous predictions may come as a surprise to some, seeing as the U.S. is enjoying strong growth, robust corporate earnings and its lowest unemployment in 17 years. The International Monetary Fund recently upped its U.S. growth forecast for 2018 to 2.9 percent. 2 Hours Ago | 00:46 
The U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders, yet 75 percent of ultra-high net worth investors predict it will hit recession by 2020, a J.P. Morgan survey found. 
Of those expecting an economic downturn in the U.S., a fifth of respondents — 21 percent — believe it will begin in 2019 and 50 percent expect the next recession to start in 2020. 
J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Spring Investment Barometer, released this week, surveyed more than 700 global private clients across Europe and the Middle East. Ultra-high net worth individuals (HNWI) are generally classified as anyone with more than $30 million in liquid financial assets, and high-net worth is defined as having more than $1 million. 
The ominous predictions may come as a surprise to some, seeing as the U.S. is enjoying strong growth, robust corporate earnings and its lowest unemployment in 17 years. The International Monetary Fund recently upped its U.S. growth forecast for 2018 to 2.9 percent. 
J.P. Morgan's Anthony Collard, head of U.K. and Nordic investments, said that while concern was evident among ultra-high net worth investors regarding America's economic future, the bank does not see signs of it being close to a recession. ""Until we see clear imbalances building, and policy approaching a point where it really constrains economic activity, we lean towards a view that the cycle will continue to expand,"" he said. show chapters 5:52 PM ET Thu, 12 April 2018 | 06:27 
But there is debate among economists as to whether this growth — fueled by a synchornized global upswing and stimulus injections like the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed corporate taxes, and an enlarged federal spending package — will last beyond 2019. 
Economists like Carl Tannenbaum at the Chicago-based Northern Trust warn that growth will not keep pace with the U.S. budget deficit, which is set to top $1 trillion in the next two years. ""Sometime in the next decade we're going to have a recession which is really going to throw us off that trajectory,"" he told CNBC this week. 
And billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates makes a similar prediction , though without a specific timeline. Asked in March if there would be another financial crisis like the one in 2008, Gates replied, ""Yes. It is hard to say when but this is a certainty."" 
Market observers also worry about the flattening of the yield curve . The short-term U.S. two-year Treasury yield is nearing that of the 10-year yield, rising to its highest level since 2008 this week. This typically triggers worries that a recession is on the horizon, since higher short-term yields suggest that inflation and interest rates are expected to remain low for a longer period. show chapters 12:32 PM ET Tue, 3 April 2018 | 01:50 
But investment professionals like Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive at Hermes Investment Management, don't see this as cause for concern — in fact, he is among those who expect the curve to steepen , meaning market players expect higher inflation and thus higher interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve, signaling a stronger economy. 
""We do not see any indications of the U.S. economy entering anything like a possible recession,"" Nusseibeh said. ""What we do see is clear indication of a stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economy."" 
Markets are expecting at least three interest rate hikes from the Fed this year. Of the ultra HNWIs surveyed by J.P. Morgan, 41 percent believe the central bank will increase rates another two times or more following the latest rate rise in March. 
""Following the first U.S. rate hike in March, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise its policy rate significantly this year,"" said Collard. ""We entered the year thinking that three 25 basis point hikes would occur in 2018, but four hikes could be possible under the right conditions.""

1500,Owners of McDonald's aren't happy with headquarters as promotions pick up and remodeling costs rise,"McDonald's is gearing up for a strong 2018, impressing investors and customers, but its franchisees aren't as happy.
In survey conducted by Nomura-Instinet, several franchisees said their relationship with corporate executives was strained. 
Among the reasons they cited were they felt pressured to adopt the brand's new value menu, add new equipment and products and to remodel their locations or face the wrath of the company, said Mark Kalinowski, a Nomura-Instinet analyst, in a research note. 
""Our CEO will be great for shareholders but long-term franchisees will suffer and so will the system,"" one franchisee was quoted as saying.
McDonald's did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
Last March, McDonald's revealed its plans to win back the more than 500 million visits it lost since 2012. The plan focused on adding new menu items, implementing digital ordering, launching delivery and renovating its restaurants.
Investors cheered these investments, driving the burger giant's stock up more than 41 percent in 2017. However, these innovations seem to have rubbed franchisees the wrong way.
""Owner/Operators around the country are not happy with the huge reinvestments they are forced to do,"" one franchisee told Kalinowski. ""Large numbers of operators will be put in financial trouble with the amounts of money they will be spending. Operators are not happy with the company direction but they will not say anything fearful of retaliation. The company [wants] little or no input from Operators. The company looks at Operators as the problem instead of
the solution.""
Notably, franchisees pointed to the installation of kiosks, which are aimed at speeding up lines and reducing mistakes, as a point of friction.
One franchisee said that adding kiosks does not address the ""real issues"" the brand is facing.
""Real issues are staffing, and the need for simplification of the restaurants,"" the franchisee said. ""We are ignoring the real issues. What good will new buildings be when we cannot deliver service because we are short-staffed. Employee turnover is at an all-time high for us. Our restaurants are way too stressful, and people do not want to work in them. Kiosks are not the answer.""
Franchisees also complained about McDonald's new value menu. They said the $1 $2 $3 Dollar menu, which launched this month, will drive sales in the first part of the year , but they fear it will drive checks lower, diminish their ability to control menu prices and raise their food costs.
Last year, McDonald's sales benefited from the introduction of $1 and $2 soft drinks promotions and McCafe beverages.
Several operators said the company has created a policy of ""say yes or leave"" when it comes to adopting these new protocols.
To be sure, not all franchisees are balking at the company's new focus. 
""While it's hard to keep up with all the changes, I think McDonald's is making many of the right moves and we are about to make a quantum leap over our competitors,"" one franchisee said. ""The years 2018, 2019, and 2020 will be good years to be in McDonald's.""
Also there has been a long history of McDonald's franchisees questioning management decisions. Last year, operators griped about the implementation of fresh beef, fearing it would slow down productivity. 
When Steve Easterbrook became CEO in 2015, McDonald's sales and earnings were slumping. Under his leadership, the brand increased its percentage of franchised stores, successfully launched promotions like All-Day Breakfast and bolstered its tech and delivery initiatives to reach lapsed customers.
But there seems to be growing tension between the C-Suite and its franchisees. When Kalinowski asked the franchisees to rate their relationship on a scale of one to five, with one being poor and five being excellent, the average response was 1.58. Six months ago, the average score was 1.62.",2018-01-23T21:22:00.000+02:00

5225,New York is investigating cryptocurrency exchanges. What you need to know,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced on Tuesday that he is investigating at least 13 cryptocurrency exchanges, including the popular platform Coinbase. 
""Too often, consumers don't have the basic facts they need to assess the fairness, integrity, and security of these trading platforms,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. 
Schneiderman said he hopes to make exchanges more accountable and transparent to their clients. Each company will be asked in a letter to supply information on its ""operations, internal controls, and safeguards to protect customer assets."" 
The news serves as a reminder that investing in cryptocurrencies is risky not only because they're new and their value is volatile — even the places where you buy them can be suspect. 
There are at least 190 exchanges in operation, with new ones popping up every day. Most of them don't operate under any rules, regulations or obligation to replace your digital money should it lose all value, get lost, stolen or hacked. One of the first exchanges to go mainstream – Mt. Gox – ended in bankruptcy .
How do exchanges even work? To get started, investors sign up with an online exchange using their bank account, credit card or digital currency. 
Yet instead of relying on a third party like a broker to execute a transaction as you typically do with a stock, bond or ETF, cryptocurrencies trade on decentralized platforms with no middle man. 
""Is it a fly-by-night operation operating out of a P.O. box in the Bahamas or is it a genuine operation, of which we have many? "" -Emin Gün Sirer, a professor at Cornell who writes about bitcoin Despite the uncertain space, experts say there are some exchanges that bring more risk than others. Here's what you should consider about where you buy and sell your cryptocurrencies.
Always remember: These assets are incredibly volatile (In December, bitcoin was trading at more than $19,000. As of Wednesday, it was at $8,116). And so never invest more than you can afford to lose.
In addition, the IRS has labelled these currencies a property, meaning every transaction needs to be recorded and eventually taxed at your capital gains rate . 
Find the right exchange for your location Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees work at the Coinbase Inc. office in San Francisco, California. Experts say if you're in the United States, you would be wise to pick an exchange based in the United States. 
Look for an address for the company. If you can't find one, that should be a red flag.
If you don't know where your exchange is located, ""when you get hacked it's going to be very difficult for you to even find the right jurisdiction in which you should sue the people who stole your money,"" said Emin Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University who writes about bitcoin.
Check the relevant policies  Chesnot | Getty Images Visual representation of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin on February 1, 2018. Not all cryptocurrency exchanges accept U.S. dollars. If you don't have any digital tokens yet, like most people , you'll need to find an exchange that takes cash. 
Make sure the exchange will work with you. For example, one of the biggest exchanges, Bitfinex, doesn't accept United States payments , citing, among other reasons, a challenging regulatory landscape. 
To that point, check your state's stance on exchanges. In 2015, New York designed rules that require cryptocurrency companies to meet certain regulatory standards.
Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has focused its attention on exchanges, requiring that certain ones register with the department. In the meantime, the agency warns investors not to assume that these exchanges meet SEC standards. 
Look into the reputation  Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images Hackers participate in the Wikimania Hackathon at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ""Is it a fly-by-night operation operating out of a P.O. box or is it a genuine operation, of which we have many?"" Gün Sirer said.
A simple Google search can turn up some telling results about potential problems. For example, when you search, ""Bitfinex hack,"" you'll quickly see a Wikipedia page dedicated to the event. You should also try to speak to other users of an exchange and inquire about their experience.
Online forums have become a magnet for cryptocurrency exchange information as well. 
""There are a lot exchanges that have been hacked,"" said Timothy Tam, co-founder and CEO of CoinFi, a cryptocurrency market intelligence platform. ""Get yourself educated.""
Confirm that there's enough security  show chapters Major bitcoin exchanges hit by cyberattacks as record rally makes them a target      11:07 AM ET Thu, 15 June 2017 | 00:38 Experts say cryptocurrency exchanges should follow what are called ""know your customer"" (KYC) and ""anti-money laundering"" (AML) procedures, which are designed to reduce the risk of illegal or fraudulent activity by certifying customers' identity. 
""If it's really easy to open an account, and it's really easy to shield your cryptocurrencies from the IRS, then it's going to be just as difficult to get your money back when things go south,"" Gün Sirer said. 
Make sure the exchange keeps the majority of its assets offline. At least 95 percent of the exchange's assets should be offline, said Tam. Coinbase, for example, says it keeps 98 percent of its customers' funds off the internet. 
Fees and ""volume""  show chapters Why is the price of bitcoin different on different exchanges?      5:08 PM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 | 01:32 Most exchanges make you weigh fees against protection, experts say.
The more secure exchanges charge a higher transaction rate. Coinbase charges a base rate of up to 4 percent for all transactions, for example, while other exchanges — with fewer guarantees, perhaps — can charge as low as 0.2 percent.
You also want to pick an exchange with high volume (you can check exchanges by volume on coinmarketcap.com ). A higher volume tends to lead to higher price accuracy, experts say, since the exchange is processing many transactions at once rather than a few an hour — over the course of which these volatile investments can lose or gain thousands of dollars. 
No matter how much you've researched and verified an exchange, don't keep too much money on it for too long, said Matti Kon, CEO of financial software company InfoTech. Instead, transfer the digital coins offline and into a hardware wallet, safe from hackers. 
""Do your thing and get off quick,"" Kon said.

3461,Cramer Remix: Blast from the past Akamai is in a sweet spot for buying,"With technology stocks top of mind for investors worried about fraying trade relations, CNBC's Jim Cramer turned to one ""blast from the past"" stock making a serious comeback: Akamai Technologies .
From 2015 to 2017, shares of Akamai, the world's largest cloud-based content delivery platform, stayed under pressure, out of favor on Wall Street and unable to bounce back.
Now, the stock is up 64 percent since its August 2017 lows, with the web content giant boasting high-profile clients like Adobe, Fox and IBM.
""While there are a few reasons for Akamai's recent strength, the main one is that an activist got involved last December, Paul Singer's Elliott Management, and Akamai has embraced their ideas almost lock, stock and barrel,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said.
Elliott Management, which took a 6.5 percent stake in Akamai, has pushed the company to cut costs, add independent directors to its board and explore strategic opportunities such as potentially putting the company up for sale.
""My view? Akamai has some extremely valuable assets, and Elliott will ... keep helping bring out the value of the enterprise, and if that value peaks or stalls, then I think the company will be put up for sale,"" Cramer said.
""The bottom line? The only thing better than a turnaround is a turnaround that's getting juiced with steroids by a very smart activist firm,"" he continued. ""That's what's happening at Akamai and it's why I like the stock right here, especially since it pulled back a few points from its highs last week, giving you an excellent entry point to do some buying.""
Defending Kudlow Scott Mlyn | CNBC Larry Kudlow On a down day for the major averages, Cramer highlighted for investors why the market could get a gift from President Donald Trump appointing CNBC host Larry Kudlow as his top economic advisor .
""First, let me distill Larry's philosophy into one word: growth,"" Cramer said on Wednesday. ""Growth is true north for this fine but forceful gentleman, and as long as the president takes him seriously about what's true north, that is good for the stock market.""
Calling Kudlow ""the most pro-growth person I've ever met,"" Cramer said that his years working with the TV personality on CNBC's ""Kudlow & Cramer"" taught him how articulate and ""at home with the media"" Kudlow was.
""That matters tremendously when you have a president who likes to take his cues from cable news, or at least the people on cable whom he agrees with,"" Cramer said.
PayPal CEO on international potential Mark Neuling | CNBC Dan Schulman For PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, the main driver of his company's gains to date has been ""the digitization of cash.""
""The entire financial system's ecosystem is moving, more rapidly than ever before, away from cash and towards digital payments because of the explosion of mobile phones,"" Schulman told CNBC on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Cramer .
With 227 million subscribers, 65 percent of whom reside outside of North America, PayPal has seized on this ""explosion"" of digital payments around the world, Schulman said, speaking from CNBC's 1Market in San Francisco.
This rapid digitization has led to countries like India and China opting for efficiency and, in some cases, skipping over financial technologies like checking accounts and credit cards in favor of digital payments, Schulman told Cramer.
Schulman also shared what running peer-to-peer payment service Venmo has shown him about how younger generations manage their money.
New SoFi CEO lists top 3 priorities Abigail Stevenson | CNBC Anthony Noto SoFi's new CEO, Twitter veteran Anthony Noto, took the CEO role at the financial technology company to help build a next-generation financial institution, he told CNBC on Wednesday.
But to outperform the rest of the increasingly crowded fintech space, the privately held SoFi needs to do three things, Noto told Cramer in an exclusive interview .
""First, we have to have the best selection — and not just selection of each product, but variations of those products,"" Noto said. ""Second, we have to provide unmatched convenience. Anytime, anywhere, on any device, you should be able to access all of your financial information, do any activity that you want across the broad spectrum of products that we'll launch over time.""
Noto's third initiative for the company — which helps its ""members,"" or customers, refinance student and mortgage loans, take out personal loans and even get career advice — had to do with speed.
Mad Money turns 13 Adam Jeffery | CNBC Jim Cramer on Mad Money. On Wednesday, ""Mad Money"" marked its 13th year on the air, and Cramer thought some thank yous were in order.
""The reason we have a 13th anniversary, the reason we have any anniversary, is that you've supported us, you've cheered us and informed us about what you need to take control of your finances. We're still on the air because of you,"" he told viewers.
""You started with us in the halcyon days of an economic expansion. You stuck with us during a horrendous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression. You fought with us to get back to even. You stayed with us as the market soared and we urged you to stay in when so many other people told you to get out,"" he continued.
The enthusiasm Cramer has seen in the last 13 years has inspired him to keep going. It has also confirmed what he's known all along: that homegamers can successfully invest for themselves.
""Believe me, as long as you keep watching — and the network doesn't haul me out of the studio in a straitjacket — I'll keep coming out here to entertain you and educate you and, hopefully, make you a better investor,"" he said. ""After 13 years, keep sticking with Cramer.""
Lightning round: Steer clear of MRK In Cramer's lightning round , he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Merck & Co. : ""Not a buyer of Merck here, even though I do like that yield. I prefer [Eli] Lilly or, more importantly, Abbott Labs .""
Phillips 66 : ""They are incredibly well-run. That stock can go higher. I have to tell you, they've created real value there. Stick with it.""

3073,Google will ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising,"Google is cracking down on cryptocurrency-related advertising.
The company is updating its financial services-related ad policies to ban any advertising about cryptocurrency-related content, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), wallets, and trading advice, Google's director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, told CNBC.
That means that even companies with legitimate cryptocurrency offerings won't be allowed to serve ads through any of Google's ad products, which place advertising on its own sites as well as third-party websites.
This update will go into effect in June 2018, according to a company post. 
""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution,"" Scott said. 
Google's hard-line approach follows a similar ban that Facebook announced earlier this year. 
While the crypto-currency boom has produced a lot of excitement and wealth , it's still a largely unregulated space and has spawned countless high-profile scams . 
This news comes as Google releases its annual ""trust and safety"" ads report. 
Google said it took down more than 3.2 billion ads in 2017 that violated its policies, which is nearly double the 1.7 billion it removed the year before. 
Google parent company Alphabet makes roughly 84 percent of its total revenue from advertising, so convincing advertisers that its ecosystem is safe and effective is critically important.

3943,"Small city of Los Alamitos opts out of California's sanctuary law, and mayor says more will follow","CNBC.com Source: KNBC Public comment period in the Los Alamitos City Council on Monday before they voted 4-1 to opt out of the California “sanctuary law.” 
A new threat to California 's ""sanctuary state"" law is coming from municipalities that are fighting the controversial legislation. 
On Monday evening, the city council in Los Alamitos, a small city in Southern California, voted 4 to 1 to exempt itself from Senate Bill 54 , also sometimes called the the ""sanctuary state"" law, which took effect in January. The state law, which is being challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice , bars local authorities from asking about the immigration status of people during routine interactions or participating in federal enforcement actions. 
""This is important for us, for our city, for our community,"" Warren Kusumoto, the mayor pro tempore of Los Alamitos said Monday before the vote. He said the local measure was needed because of ""a conflict between two governing documents — the Constitution of the United States and the state constitution itself."" 
Added Kusumoto, ""We have a military base over here, we have contractors here who do business with the federal government. And I just feel that this body owes them some kind of certainty and guidance in enacting this ordinance. It really is for us to say we believe in the Constitution."" 
""The Los Alamitos City Council and Councilman Kusumoto in particular, are egregiously misinterpreting the U.S. Constitution and are on the wrong side of history,"" California Assembly member Wendy Carrillo, a Democrat who represents parts of Los Angeles, said in a statement. ""Los Alamitos has an opportunity to protect its residents, but is instead siding with a racist and xenophobic Trump administration hell-bent on instilling fear in immigrants across the nation."" 
Los Alamitos, a city of about 12,000 people in Orange County, now finds itself in the spotlight with its challenge to California's sanctuary movement. 
""I've gotten a lot of calls from other city council members and other mayors that are interested in being part of this,"" Los Alamitos Mayor Troy Edgar said Tuesday. ""They really want to know what was the process and are trying to get advice on how to go to the next steps."" 
A second vote is required for the measure to take effect, and that vote is expected April 16. 
According to the mayor, at least 13 other municipalities in the state are considering similar opt-out measures on the sanctuary law. He wouldn't identify the cities but said they are located in the high deserts of Southern California as well as Orange and San Diego counties, all the way up to Northern California's Shasta County. 
""It's great to see cities in California fighting back against the illegal sanctuary state and lawlessness of the California Democrats,"" said Assemblyman Travis Allen, a Republican candidate for governor whose Assembly district includes Los Alamitos. 
However, immigration lawyer and University of Southern California law professor Jean Reisz said Los Alamitos' decision to opt out of SB 54, or the California Values Act , shouldn't legally support the federal government's overall position. 
""Whether or not Los Alamitos opted out, that's not evidence that these laws are in violation of federal law,"" said Reisz. ""It's just showing the city isn't in support of it or doesn't want to follow it."" She also believes California's SB 54 and two other statutes that are part of the federal government's legal challenge against the state ""don't violate federal law."" 
Meantime, the Los Alamitos mayor said he has not personally heard from state officials since passing the opt-out ordinance. ""I would expect that they are definitely considering what their options are,"" he said. 
In addition to passing the ordinance, the mayor said the city plans to file an amicus brief in support of the Trump administration's ""sanctuary law"" case against California. The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. 
The Trump administration's suit against California, filed March 6, contends that three different state laws passed last year to protect undocumented immigrants against deportation violate the U.S. Constitution. 
The state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said at a press conference after the lawsuit was filed that California has the right under the U.S. Constitution ""to decline to participate in civil immigration enforcement. California is in the business of public safety. We're not in the business of deportations."" 
Becerra's office said Tuesday, ""We will continue to defend attacks against the Values Act."" 
The office of Gov. Jerry Brown declined to comment for this story. 
In November, a USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll showed more than 50 percent of Californians supported the ""sanctuary state"" law. ",2018-03-21T01:17:00.000+02:00
1585,Netflix gets rare downgrade due to worries over its spending on content,"Michael Newberg | CNBC Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix. 
Most of Wall Street is gushing over Netflix shares after the company crushed fourth-quarter subscriber expectations, but one analyst says it is time for investors to take some profits. 
Buckingham Research Group lowered its rating for Netflix shares to neutral from buy, citing concerns over the company's spending on content to boost profit down the road. 
""We are confident in Netflix's position as a global streaming leader with new entrants like Disney more apt to be complements than replacements,"" analyst Matthew Harrigan wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Nonetheless, continued share momentum depends on market confidence that NFLX's guided $3.0-4.0B in negative 2018 free cash flow will generate superior investment returns."" 
Netflix said it added 8.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with expectations for 6.4 million. show chapters 5 Hours Ago | 03:20 
The shares rose 10 percent on Tuesday, closing at $250.29, giving it a market value of roughly $108 billion. Netflix stock is up 66 percent in the past 12-months through Monday. 
Harrigan raised his price target for Netflix shares to $257 from $251, representing 13 percent upside to Monday's close. 
The analyst noted the rising risks from Netflix's well-financed media and internet competitors. 
""Even CEO Reed Hastings is open kimono that the global migration to IPTV content will attract new entrants and accelerating commitments from those currently engaged, which include deep pocketed tech companies like Amazon and companies with significant programming access like Hulu and European public broadcasters,"" he wrote. 
Netflix stock downgrades are a rare occurrence on Wall Street in recent years. The last time the company was downgraded was in Sept. 2016, when Macquarie lowered its rating to underperform from neutral.

1955,Over $60 billion wiped off value of cryptocurrencies as bitcoin drops to lowest level since Nov 18,"Bitcoin fell below $8,000 for the third time in four days on Monday amid a broader sell-off in cryptocurrencies that has seen over $60 billion of valued erased from the market in 24 hours. 

The price of bitcoin traded as low as $7,178.65 on Monday and sat below the $8,000 mark for most of the morning's trade, according to CoinDesk. It's the lowest price for bitcoin since November 16. CoinDesk's bitcoin price index tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex.
On Friday, bitcoin fell below $8,000 for the first time since November 24. It then rose above $9,000 over the weekend before falling below $8,000 on Sunday. 
It was not only bitcoin that fell either. Other major virtual currencies, including ethereum and ripple , fell sharply in the last 24 hours. The market capitalization or value of the entire cryptocurrency market fell to around $350 billion around 11:23 a.m., ET, Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. This was a drop of around $67.7 billion in 24 hours.
Regulation concerns The digital currency world has been plagued by a string of worrying headlines.
Tougher regulation has been a key factor weighing on price. India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said last week that the country wants to ""eliminate"" the use of digital currencies in criminal activities, signaling tighter regulation in the country.
show chapters One key event that crypto traders are watching next week      5:59 PM ET Fri, 2 Feb 2018 | 02:56 On Monday, Financial News, a publication closely affiliated with the People's Bank of China, reported that the central bank will block all platforms related to cryptocurrency trading and the issuance of so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs). Previously it had stamped out domestic cryptocurrency exchanges but it extended its crackdown to foreign platforms too.
""In the future, any related (platform) will be closed as soon as it is found. At the same time, further regulatory measures will be taken with the future development of the situation,"" the Financial News reported.
Major banks are also starting to curb the use of their services to buy cryptocurrencies. On Monday, major U.K. lender Lloyds Banking Group said that it was stopping people buying cryptocurrencies using credit cards. The move follows U.S. banks J.P. Morgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup , who implemented the same policy last week .
Other worries are plaguing the digital currency market, particularly around a cryptocurrency called tether. Some experts have suggested that tether, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, could be being created to prop up the bitcoin price.
$100,000 bitcoin ahead? Still, there are bullish voices in the market.
Fundstrat's Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to issue formal price targets on bitcoin, said in January that $9,000 is a ""major low"" for bitcoin and ""the biggest buying opportunity in 2018."" 
Lee issued another report last week that maintained his $25,000 price target for bitcoin.
And Kay Van-Petersen, a Saxo Bank analyst who correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's rally at the start of 2017, told CNBC recently that bitcoin could hit between $50,000 and $100,000 this year.",2018-02-05T13:36:00.000+02:00
3152,"Coinbase's bitcoin cash trading rollout cost investors $5 million, lawsuit says","Getty Images Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong 
Coinbase's botched roll-out of bitcoin cash trading cost investors more than $5 million, a lawsuit alleges. 
Coinbase is the leading U.S. marketplace for buying major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. After the cryptocurrency split into bitcoin and bitcoin cash last summer, Coinbase said it would make the offshoot coin available on its site by Jan. 1. 
Then the company surprised everyone by trying unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin cash trading earlier, on Dec. 19. As bitcoin cash prices soared that day, many outside investors speculated that Coinbase employees had been tipped off to the early start of trading. 
On Thursday, lawyers filed a lawsuit seeking class action status in the Northern District of California on behalf of customers who say they were damaged by ""negligence in the handling of the launch."" 
The San Francisco-based company said it would not comment on the case. 
""Our priority has always been, and remains, maintaining our customers' trust,"" Coinbase said in a statement. ""We go to great lengths to provide comprehensive information needed to make investment decisions and to safeguard the integrity of our platform, and we hold ourselves to the highest standards of conduct."" 
Coinbase began its own internal investigation of insider trading around the December bitcoin cash trading launch and tweeted at the time that its employees had been ""prohibited from trading in bitcoin cash for several weeks."" Neither CEO Brian Armstrong or the company have disclosed any results of that investigation. 
Following a prolonged controversy, a minority of bitcoin developers in August created a split-off cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. Similar to a stock split, bitcoin investors at the time of the split should have received an equivalent amount of bitcoin cash. 
However, Coinbase did not immediately allow trading in bitcoin cash. When the company did its surprise December trading rollout, bitcoin cash soared well above $3,000. The short notice didn't allow enough interest from buyers and sellers to build before trading launched. Four minutes later, trading was suspended as a lack of sellers caused high volatility, according to a company representative. 
Coinbase eventually rolled out bitcoin cash trading the following day. The bitcoin offshoot was trading near $1,182 Tuesday, while bitcoin was around $10,634, according to data from CoinDesk.

In a separate case filed filed last week against Coinbase, a California and a Michigan resident claimed the crypto company emailed them fractions of a bitcoin in 2013 when it was trading below $200, according to CoinDesk. 
Bitcoin prices since late 2013 
Source: CoinDesk 
Many of these emails were disregarded, and the bitcoin went unclaimed. Instead of notifying the plaintiffs, or turning those digital currency over to the State of California, Coinbase kept them, according to court documents. 
There were two plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed Thursday, but the class could eventually include thousands of members, the court documents said. 
This is the latest headache for Coinbase. In February, some customers were overcharged after what the company said was system glitch from changes in the way credit-card payments were issued. Visa later said Coinbase was not at fault. Later in February, a federal court judge ordered Coinbase to identify more than 14,000 accounts to the IRS, which is looking to see if users were evading taxes.

6349,Blackberry CEO: This safety plan would 'defeat the purpose' of self-driving cars,"Autonomous vehicles, in particular self-driving cars, have been generating a great deal of buzz in the market over the past few years. The technology has many potential benefits for individuals, the environment and the economy.
Recently however, as a consequence of tragic accidents caused by cars in self-driving mode , an irrational discussion is surfacing.
Some are calling for driverless cars to require driver monitoring systems. These systems would ensure that drivers of d riverless cars – a contradiction in terms – are alert and have their eyes on the road at all times, even when a vehicle is in self-driving mode.
Driver monitoring systems may be necessary during self-driving vehicle testing and can benefit driver operated vehicles on the road today but, the requirement for production ready autonomous vehicles to be equipped with the systems is a different ask and one that I disagree with.
""The AV START Act would be a good place to begin with the ultimate goal being to have a globally harmonized policy."" Arguably, the most important benefit of self-driving vehicles is safety. Globally over a million people are killed each year in vehicle accidents and fifty million more are injured, with almost all of the accidents attributable to human error.
Self-driving vehicles are poised to significantly reduce the number of road accidents and deaths by eliminating human drivers and therefore human error. This translates to positive GDP growth; if the number of road deaths in China were halved, for example, it is estimated that they would see a 15 percent increase in their GDP . ‎
Driver monitoring systems cannot be the safety solution for autonomous vehicles. If vehicles in self-driving mode are made to require driver intervention for accident prevention, it defeats the core purpose of the technology and puts the safety problem back on the table.
As well it could make the driver liable for any accidents, even those that occur when the vehicle is in self-driving mode.
The fatal accidents that have occurred in self-driving cars should instead serve as a wake-up call to the fact that, despite the hype and haste of the market to make autonomous vehicles available for sale, we have more work to do to make the technology safe.
Equally important, considerable effort must be put in by the private and public sectors in defining safety regulations and policies.
If self-driving vehicles continue to be developed and allowed on the road without safety standards being put in place by the federal government there are real risks. Safety must be the number one priority for autonomous vehicles.
Meeting standards Governments across different countries have been asked by a number of industry players, including trade groups and consumer groups, to develop regulations that define what 'safe' and 'secure' means for a driverless vehicle. The AV START Act would be a good place to begin with the ultimate goal being to have a globally harmonized policy.
The AV START Act, introduced by Senators John Thune and Gary Peters in September 2017, calls for the federal government to develop performance standards for autonomous vehicles.
Requirements of the proposed framework include having vehicles meet standards of hardware and software system safety – for instance how a vehicle communicates with infrastructure such as traffic signals and pavement markings – and supply chain cybersecurity measures with mechanisms to alert passengers of vulnerabilities.
Federal government regulations and safety standards are key to delivering the much needed focus on safety and bringing the envisioned benefits of autonomous vehicles to fruition. Without them the technology is in danger of being made available before it is ready.
Importantly, the safety buck does not stop once the car has been built. Sophisticated tools and infrastructure are a must have to monitor a vehicles security position in-field. In today's increasingly connected world the cybersecurity landscape is changing constantly, making it important to scan a vehicle's software for vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis even after it has left the manufacturer.
Additionally, driver monitoring poses privacy concerns. The systems cannot only assess and log if you are doing something other than looking at the road, they can also evaluate how tired you are and determine your mood and emotions through constant visual and vocal assessment. The possibilities this would present to players, such as hackers and insurance firms, will do little to benefit you.
As the future is brought to reality, your security and safety must be put at the forefront.

34,"Comcast beats earnings expectations, adding 350,000 high-speed internet customers","Consumers may be cutting the cord, but Comcast 's bets on high-speed internet and film franchises are providing fresh sources of growth.
The media and cable giant reported quarterly earnings on Wednesday that beat analyst expectations, and revenue that topped estimates, as the company grew its customer base in high-speed internet and business services, offsetting lost customers in video services.
It also announced plans to increase its dividend by 21 percent and to repurchase at least $5 billion in stock in 2018.
Here's how the company did in the fourth quarter:
EPS: 49 cents per share, adjusted vs. 47 cents expected by Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $21.92 billion vs. $21.82 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters. 
A year earlier, Comcast reported adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $21.03 billion. 
Shares were flat in Wednesday's premarket after the announcement. 
The financial results of the owner of CNBC parent NBCUniversal set the stage for rivals that are also exploring combinations of content and internet services.
Cable and internet business 
Comcast's Xfinity is one of the biggest residential providers of video, internet and phone. Comcast now has 29.3 million customers.
Comcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, slightly less than a year earlier, but still the largest source of sales growth for the company. But 33,000 video customers left during the quarter, a change Comcast attributed to more ""aggressive"" offers from traditional and emerging competitors.
Still, it's better than analysts expected. Comcast was expected to lose 45,000 video subscribers and gain 312,000 high-speed internet customers, according to a FactSet consensus estimate. Comcast lost 13,000 voice customers during the quarter, narrower than the 23,000 customer loss forecast by FactSet.
Media business 
NBC's film division had its most profitable year ever in its 105-year history, the company said Wednesday. In addiiton, Universal Pictures hit $5 billion at the global box office over the holidays for the second time ever. But during the quarter, film revenue dropped by about 5 percent, despite hits like ""Fate of the Furious,"" ""Despicable Me 3"" and the latest installment of ""Pitch Perfect.""
Theme parks, broadcast and cable networks also saw revenue increases from a year earlier, thanks to new attractions at the parks and distribution and content licensing.
The company has a big quarter ahead in media, with the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics next month.
Comcast's earnings is closely watched in the media industry. The combination of content and the ""pipes"" to deliver it is something that other companies are exploring as well: Verizon has Yahoo and AOL, and now Time Warner and AT&T hope to seal a merger deal. Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox are also joining forces.

4014,"A once-hot sector is turning cold, and that could signal trouble with the consumer","show chapters Time to ditch one of the best S&P 500 sectors of 2018? 17 Hours Ago | 07:08 The consumer is becoming cautious and that's making discretionary spending stocks a riskier bet this year, says one market strategist.
""At this stage of the cycle, with the Fed committed to raising interest rates over the next two years, we've got to lighten up and sell high,"" Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, told CNBC's "" Trading Nation "" on Tuesday.
Tepper recently changed his position on consumer discretionary to underweight on the twin threats of a Federal Reserve ready to raise rates and a consumer laden with debt.
""There's no doubt that the consumer has been on fire,"" says Tepper. ""However, that pace just can't be sustained.""
Consumer spending has already shown the beginnings of a slowdown. Retail sales in February fell for a third month in a row, a surprise to economists looking for a slight gain and its longest stretch of declines since 2012. Fourth-quarter sales were at their strongest in seven years.
""The consumer is far from dead, but we see enough warning signs out there on the horizon that have caused us to just scale back given the fact that we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this bull market,"" said Tepper.
What money consumers have spent has largely been funded by credit and debt. Household debt in the U.S. over the fourth quarter increased at its fastest pace in a decade, while the personal savings rate dropped to its lowest level since 2008.
""At this point even a modest tick down in consumer confidence coupled with rebuilding up that savings can really dent consumer spending,"" said Tepper.
If the Fed raises rates as expected this year, interest rates on consumer loans will rise and the availability of cheap debt will drop. The central bank is expected to raise rates at least three times this year, the first as soon as next week.
Higher and more expensive debt could have consumers cutting down on expenses, says Tepper. The first casualties, he says, will be companies that rely on non-essential spending, such as Harley Davidson and Tiffany .
""They represent products that aren't a necessity,"" he said. ""People still need to drive their Ford back and forth to work, but having a Harley isn't a must so stocks like those are going to be negatively impacted.""
Starbucks could also be victim to more conservative spending, says Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. Its share performance already has the company's stock at risk.
""The stock has been stuck in this range for quite some time,"" Maley said on ""Trading Nation."" ""It made a double top here in 2015 and 2017, so if it breaks below that into that range it would confirm a double top is in place and it would be quite negative for the stock.""
Starbucks, Harley-Davidson and Tiffany's have already underperformed the broader sector in the year to date. Since the beginning of 2018, Starbucks has added 2 percent, while Harley-Davidson has dropped 14 percent and Tiffany's 3 percent. The XLY Consumer Discretionary ETF is up 7 percent.

775,"US dollar will get slammed if NAFTA dies, analyst Jens Nordvig says","Market Insider US dollar will get slammed if NAFTA dies, analyst Jens Nordvig says If the U.S. pulls out of NAFTA, the peso could lose as much as 10 percent but the dollar could also get slammed against a host of currencies, according to Exante Data CEO Jens Nordvig. The dollar could end up losing out to the euro and yen if the U.S. proceeds with protectionist activity, and could ultimately be less attractive as a reserve currency, he said. Earlier, the dollar moved lower on a report that Chinese officials were considering buying fewer or stopping purchases of Treasury securities due to their unattractiveness but also trade issues. SHARES 
Protectionism may be a problem for the U.S. dollar. 
If the U.S. pulls out of NAFTA, the Mexican peso could lose as much as another 10 percent, but the U.S. dollar could also get slammed against major world currencies, according to Jens Nordvig, CEO of Exante Data. Getty Images 
The currency strategist said U.S. protectionism is one of the biggest threats to the dollar and one of the biggest sources of dollar volatility. 
Reuters Wednesday quoted unnamed Canadian government officials saying they are increasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The next round of talks is scheduled for Jan. 23 in Canada. 
The peso lost 0.9 percent, and the Canadian dollar fell one percent on the report. 
Nordvig said the size of the Canadian dollar's decline is unusual, and the loonie has not previously reacted as intensely during prior NAFTA scares. If NAFTA fails, he said the Canadian dollar would decline further but not as much as the five to 10 percent decline he expects to see in the peso. 
""Mexico is more vulnerable. Over time, we think the Mexican move is going to play out more forcefully. What the dollar does on a global scale is more tricky,"" said Nordvig. 
If the 24 year old treaty is tossed, years of integration between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. will be at risk. Supporters of NAFTA claim prices will rise if the U.S. kills the trade deal, and the U.S. will find itself at the start of what could turn into trade wars. But critics of NAFTA say it has allowed U.S. manufacturing and workers to be undermined by low cost goods coming in from Mexico, which has a $60 billion trade deficit with the U.S. 
""The dollar will suffer against the euro but the market is not really having a clear view on this. The euro is actually down on these headlines. The market is actually so confused about what it means for the global dollar,"" said Nordvig. 
Earlier Wednesday, the dollar sank on another trade related story. Bloomberg reported that unnamed Chinese officials were considering stopping purchases of U.S. Treasurys because of their unattractiveness but also trade issues. 
The Trump administration is expected to make recommendations on steel and aluminum this month that could impact China. 
But Nordvig said it would take a much bigger trade event than product tarriffs to really damage the dollar, and if the U.S. does engage in full scale protectionism, the dollar could ultimatley be seen as less attractive as a reserve currency. 
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico have held five rounds of talks to renegotiate NAFTA but U.S. demands on how trade issues are resolved and the treaty's permanence have been among the thorny issues for Canada and Mexico. 
Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called a case filed by Canada with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. for U.S. disciplinary practices and procedures ""a broad and ill-advised attack"" on the U.S. trade remedies system. 
""Even if Canada succeeded on these groundless claims, other countries would primarily benefit, not Canada. For example, if the U.S. removed the orders listed in Canada's complaint, the flood of imports from China and other countries would negatively impact billions of dollars in Canadian exports to the United States, including nearly $9 billion in exports of steel and aluminum products and more than $2.5 billion in exports of wood and paper products,"" the trade representative said in a statement.

President Donald Trump is set to discuss school and community safety with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Wednesday.
The meeting, scheduled after a gunman toting a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle killed 17 students and teachers at a Florida high school, could bring members of Congress closer to implementing some of the various gun control measures proposed since the shooting.
Trump himself has advocated supplying ""firearms adept"" teachers with concealed guns to deter school shooters. He has said that 20 percent of teachers might be eligible, and that those who undergo annual training should receive a bonus.
Trump tweet armed teachers 
Last week, Trump directed his Justice Department to craft regulations that would ban ""bump stocks"" — attachments that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire continuously. The weapon modifier was used during a massacre last year at a Las Vegas concert. 
The president also said he favors strengthening background checks to focus more on mental health, as well as raising the federal minimum age to buy some guns to 21 from 18 — a policy staunchly opposed by the National Rifle Association .
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders announced Wednesday that reporters had been asked to monitor the meeting for an extended time period. But ""due to this expanded access with the president,"" she said, a previously scheduled press briefing was cancelled.

(Recasts with protestors slow to demobilize)
SAO PAULO, May 28 (Reuters) - A nationwide protest by Brazilian truckers was slow to unwind on Monday, even after the week-long demonstrations against diesel price hikes got the government to cave to their demands, causing stocks and the currency to slide.
Brazilian truckers association Abcam, which says it represents at least 600,000 independent truck drivers, called on members to stand down, but warned that unwinding protests would take time.
""We are working to spread the word of a deal to all the drivers,"" Abcam said in a written statement. ""It is worth remembering that even though we are calling for an end to the blockades, not all protesters agree with that.""
By Monday night, most of the country had not returned to any semblance of normality.
The truckers' protest left South America's biggest city and economic hub Sao Paulo, and hundreds of communities across the country, without fuel, emptying normally gridlocked roads. Hospitals said they were running out of supplies.
Schools canceled classes, businesses told employees to work from home and virtually every part of the powerhouse agribusiness sector said the damage was massive, if not yet quantifiable.
In a televised Sunday night address, President Michel Temer said he signed three decrees with immediate effect to address the main demands of truck drivers, adding that ""we gave everything they asked for.""
One of the decrees cuts the price of diesel at the pump by 12 percent for 60 days, another ordered toll operators across the country not to charge for rear axles that are not in use and another mandates the minimum fare paid to truckers for freight.
Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said on Monday that the measures Temer announced will cost 9.5 billion reais ($2.54 billion), of which 3.8 billion will come from cutting government expenses.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index dropped 4.5 percent, sliding into negative territory for the first time this year. Leading the losses was a nearly 15 percent plunge by Petroleo Brasileiro SA due to investor concerns about political interference in the state-led oil company's fuel pricing policy.
Brazil's currency also lost about 1.6 percent on Monday against the U.S. dollar on concerns about further pressure on the government's gaping fiscal deficit.
""The market is focused on the fiscal problem, with the impact the government's actions will have on public accounts,"" said Fernando Bergallo, head of currency at FB Capital.
Guardia acknowledged that the truckers' protests would have a ""relevant"" impact on this year's gross domestic product.
In the central bank's weekly survey released Monday, economists polled revised their economic growth forecasts to 2.37 percent growth in 2018, down from a median forecast of 2.5 percent the week before.
In a sign of the uncertainty of how or when the protest may wind down, one of the leaders of independent truckers in Rio de Janeiro, Vicente Reis, said that drivers were not happy with what Temer offered.
""We are not satisfied with what was offered, nor even with who was negotiating,"" Reis said. ""Our goal is no longer just a cut in diesel prices. We won the support of society and now we want a reduction in the costs of other fuels.""

5486,Why a 'blue wave' in the midterm elections won't be enough,"Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty Images Protesters hold a placard reading 'Pro America - Anti-Trump'. 
A blue wave is coming. At least, that's what people say , and as November 6th draws closer you hear it more and more. Some scream it, as if the words, said loudly enough, will drown out the daily torrent of Trump's actions and words. Some whisper it, afraid of encouraging apathy or otherwise jinxing a sure thing. But is a blue wave likely? And if it comes, what would it mean? Republicans historically turn out more reliably during midterm elections than Democrats. It's true that, as of today, Republican voters have plenty of reasons to be frustrated with President Trump who has yet to deliver on several of his highest profile proposed policies, including the border wall with Mexico and a true, universal ban on Muslims entering the country ""until we figure things out."" Even so, the base that today might be weary of Trump could rally to his defense if they believed they faced some true threat, in the form of a conveniently timed war, terrorist attack, or existential threat to Donald Trump's presidency itself. 
Witness the defamation campaign against Special Counsel Robert Mueller that right-wing pundits have thrown themselves into wholeheartedly this year. How will his base respond when Mueller finally releases his findings from the Russia probe? Donald Trump famously said that he could murder someone on 5th Avenue and get away with it. I've seen nothing since his inauguration to make me doubt that. The Republicans have other reasons to be confident. A recent report projected that the Democrats would need to win the popular vote by almost 11 percentage points to retake the House. This is no coincidence. It is the result of decades of increasingly extreme gerrymandering nationwide that has so perverted our political system that only a near impossible set of variables coming into perfect alignment could allow the people to elect the House they desire. Factor in voter suppression efforts, social media manipulation from both inside and outside of our country's borders, and racist defunding of polling places in lower socioeconomic areas and the effect is even stronger. The hypothesized wave had better be a big one if it's going to have any chance of breaching the Republicans' gerrymandered levees. Still, Democrats have been winning special elections by massive margins over the past six months, with candidates routinely beating Hillary Clinton's results by 10-30 points. So let's assume the pattern continues, Democrats show up to vote, and they pull off a wave, retaking the House of Representatives and maybe even the Senate. I'm here to say that a wave is not enough to fix the systemic economic and social issues that gave us Donald Trump in the first place. 
A wave is not enough if the DCCC and the DNC continue their scorched earth campaign against progressive primary challengers as they did against Laura Moser in Texas last month, putting their thumb on the scales to ensure that only their favored, milquetoast candidates make it through to the general election. These tactics serve only to turn off the progressive voters that will be so vital come November. 
A wave is not enough if, in our own self-congratulatory enthusiasm, we allow it to focus only on the House and the Senate, ignoring the monumentally important task of electing progressives as mayors, to state legislatures, and in oft-overlooked district attorney elections that hold the key to criminal justice reform. Take a look at what Larry Krasner is accomplishing in Philadelphia in combating mass incarceration to see how crucial down ballot elections can be. A wave is not enough if, by the time it comes, we've squandered the opportunity to shape that wave in primaries across the country. November 6th is important, but we're in the middle of a far more consequential set of elections right now. States are holding primaries for candidates who will soon hope to ride this electoral wave, and if it ends up being as strong as many hope, then these primaries will be where the real work is done. These primaries are where voters will decide not just which party should hold power, but WHY they should hold power, and to what end. Will the blue wave sweep into power another set of corporate friendly, establishment Democrats who will muddle their way spinelessly through a term or two in office before being inevitably swept back out of power? Or will a new generation of progressives come into office energized and ready to make good on the promise of the wave – that our leaders will finally deliver on the economy, health care, income inequality, the environment, and so many other vital areas? A wave is not enough, but the right wave – a truly progressive wave – could be exactly what America needs and deserves.

1363,MH370 mystery: Search resumes for the plane that went missing nearly four years ago,"Search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished from radar screens in March 2014, will begin anew this month, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported Wednesday.
The resumption comes after Malaysian authorities took up an offer by U.S. exploration firm Ocean Infinity to continue looking for the plane, the report said.
The company, in a statement , said the search is estimated to last 90 days and it will receive payment only if the aircraft wreckage is found.
""Ocean Infinity's search will focus initially on the zone identified by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau,"" the company said.
The missing plane, a Boeing 777, was carrying 239 people en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur when it disappeared from radar screens. Search operations concentrated in the southern Indian Ocean, but the aircraft was not found.
Three confirmed fragments of MH370 have been found on the western shores of the Indian Ocean, The Star said. But the initial deep-sea search — jointly conducted by Australia , China and Malaysia — was called off in January 2017.

7041,The one area of the market that may be secretly wishing for inflation: retail,"show chapters Retailers could be on verge of regaining pricing power, money manager suggests 20 Hours Ago | 01:23 Wall Street may be perceiving inflation as a stock market risk, but J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Jack Caffrey suggests there's at least one group that may be secretly hoping for it.
""I actually think most retailers would actually benefit from a discussion about inflation,"" the firm's equity portfolio manager said Monday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" ""That might actually catalyze the consumer to actually spend sooner rather than waiting with the anticipation that it will be cheaper.""
After years of deflation, Caffrey notes that the idea of somewhat higher prices could reignite excitement — a factor that's typically bullish for the group.
Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.
""I actually think inflation might help some of the retailers actually start prompting somewhat better comparisons,"" he added.
It's possible big retailers reporting quarterly numbers this week, such as Macy's , Walmart and Nordstrom , could give guidance about inflation. But for now, Caffrey believes it's too early to determine if rising prices will fetch bigger profits. So he's staying neutral on the space.
But there are two areas he's confident will benefit from rising inflation.
""Certainly, financials might be beneficiaries if this leads to a higher interest rate environment or concerns of higher interest rates ,"" Caffrey said. ""It could also be helpful for the energy stocks to the extent that higher inflation is caused by higher oil [and] higher gasoline prices.""

2612,Cancer research breakthrough shows a better way to predict drugs that will work,"Cancer patients need time and drugs that, over time, are effective. They might have more of both according to the results of a new study by researchers in Britain and Italy.
The study, just published in Science , showed that the creation of what the researchers are calling microtumors can help predict drug effectiveness in cancer patients better than the current standard method of testing the drugs on rodents. Researchers took biopsies from 71 colorectal cancer patients and made ""cancer organoids,"" or cell culture models of cancerous organs. Researchers then treated these microtumors with drugs and observed the effectiveness in the laboratory.
In the past, doctors predicted how effective a treatment would be by growing cancer in mice. This process took six to eight months. The microtumors grow in a 3-D matrix called a matrigel, and the whole process only takes six to eight weeks.
Dr. Nicola Valeri, the lead clinician of the study and a team leader at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the results are encouraging for multiple reasons: growing cancers in mice costs more, takes longer, and has lower effectiveness scores.
Drugs that worked in the microtumor worked 88 percent of the time on humans, and drugs that failed in the microtumor failed 100 percent of the time in the patient. Valeri said drugs that work in mice have only proved effective in 60 to 70 percent of human patients.
If doctors can more accurately predict what drugs will treat someone's cancer, they can select the right drugs for the right patients. If they know for sure what drugs won't work, they can spare patients the painful side effects.
""You can avoid unnecessary toxicity to patients who won't benefit,"" Valeri said. ""You can switch to another treatment. You can avoid a treatment that doesn't work.""
According to a 2015 research study in the Journal of American Medical Association , many new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration don't improve overall survival. The researchers examined 63 indications for approval and found that only 30 percent of them were approved based on overall survival.
Valeri doesn't know when this microtumor testing option will become widely available, but he thinks the medical community is closer than most people think.
""We're putting patients in trials as we speak,"" he said.

2824,A tropical nation is putting India's foreign policy ambitions to the test,"A simmering political crisis in the Maldives, a luxury travel hotspot , has evolved into a litmus test for India's foreign policy intentions in Asia.
The former leader of the Muslim-majority nation, famed for idyllic beaches but currently under a state of emergency, has requested New Delhi send troops. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision on the matter could ultimately represent how his country intends to lead in a region with rising Chinese influence and extremism.
""If India cannot even safeguard its primary interests so close to its mainland, then it can hardly be trusted to become a net security provider for the wider region,"" Rumel Dahiya, a retired Indian army brigadier, said in a recent note published by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, a New Delhi-based think tank.
Since authoritarian President Abdulla Yameen came to power in 2013, rule of law in the Maldives has steadily deteriorated, but the situation hit a boiling point last week . Tightening his grip on power, Yameen jailed high-ranking members of the judiciary, including Supreme Court Justice Ali Hameed, as well as former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
That prompted former leader Mohamed Nasheed, widely credited for bringing democracy to the archipelago, to ask India for help. In a Twitter post on Feb. 6, Nasheed requested that New Delhi send an envoy, backed by the Indian military, and called on Washington to halt any transactions through American banks tied to Yameen's regime.
show chapters It looks like the India-China rivalry is spreading to another front 9:17 AM ET Thu, 28 Dec 2017 | 00:51 Like most South Asian countries, the Maldives depends on India — the region's dominant power — for security and trade. In 1988, New Delhi sent troops to the island-nation to foil a coup and many Indian defense hawks believe it remains India's responsibility to safeguard Maldivian politics — ""the stakes are the highest for India,"" Dahiya described.
Modi's decision however, may ultimately rest on external factors such as Beijing and the Islamic State.
The China element Yameen, whose poor human rights record has been criticized by the United Nations and the White House, has been cozying up to Beijing in recent years, marking a defined detour from the country's historic reliance on India.
Under the continent-spanning Belt and Road program, the world's second-largest economy has been heavily investing in South Asia, including in the construction of a bridge and an airport runway in the Maldives.
Fears are now rampant that projects funded by Beijing along the Belt and Road will translate into increased Chinese political influence . Last year, the Asian giant formally launched its first overseas military base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. And there are concerns that the communist state may do the same in Pakistan , Sri Lanka as well as the Maldives, located near major shipping and energy routes.
""From Beijing's point of view, the Maldives could offer a critical naval port and air base to help safeguard these important sea lines of communication,"" political intelligence firm Stratfor said in a recent note.
AFP/Getty Images The under-construction China Maldives Friendship Bridge is pictured near the city of Male on February 8, 2018. That's not a desirable scenario for Modi, who aims to tighten relations with Asian neighbors under his ""Act East"" foreign policy. India fears Chinese investments in the Maldives may presage an eventual military presence, so it essentially wants a sympathetic leader, such as Nasheed, in power to advance Indian interests, Statfor explained.
Sending in troops, however, could work against that goal.
""[It] would undoubtedly reinforce New Delhi's image as a domineering hegemon unafraid to use force against its smaller neighbors,"" Statfor said.
""Such a reaction could tilt the regional political scales in China's favor, which already has benefited from anti-Indian sentiment at play during December elections in Nepal ,"" it added.
Islamic State is a factor, too An Indian military presence could also fuel religious extremism on the archipelago.
For decades, the Maldives was a moderate Islamic nation, but in recent years, it's shifted toward the ultra-conservative ideology of Salafism, an Islamic movement . The nation now reportedly supplies South Asia's highest per capita contribution of foreign fighters to terror networks in Syria and Iraq .
""Any intervention by India can be spun into an anti-Islamic rhetoric in the island, by interests inimical to Indian influence in the Indian Ocean,"" New Delhi-based research group Observer Research Foundation said in a recent note.
""Yameen [knows] this far too well, and might just be waiting for India to take the misstep — it would help his cause in cementing his role as a defender and protector of the faith.""",2018-02-13T07:34:00.000+02:00
2041,"Walmart earnings fall short of estimates, sending shares lower","Walmart on Tuesday reported earnings that missed analysts' expectations for the holiday period as its e-commerce operations cooled off, overshadowing the fact that same-store sales and revenue surpassed forecasts.
The company's gross margins took a hit during the quarter due to promotional activity and an ongoing war with Amazon to win a larger share of the grocery and apparel industries. The Arkansas-based retailer has been investing heavily to keep inventory fresh and stores appealing.
""During the quarter, [Walmart] had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction,"" CFO Brett Biggs said.
Meanwhile, sales made on Walmart.com slowed significantly, igniting fears that the big-box retailer won't be able to keep pace with Amazon.com. For comparison, Amazon's revenues, which include sales from grocer Whole Foods, jumped nearly 40 percent in the latest period.
Shares of Walmart fell more than 9 percent Tuesday morning on the news.
Here's how Walmart did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a Thomson Reuters survey:
Earnings per share: $1.33, adjusted, vs. $1.37 expected Revenue: $136.3 billion vs. $134.9 billion expected U.S. same-store sales: an increase of 2.6 percent vs. a 2.2 percent rise expected Walmart reported net income of $2.17 billion, or 73 cents a share, compared with $3.76 billion, or $1.22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Walmart earned $1.33 a share, falling 4 cents short of analysts' estimates.
Total sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 climbed 4.1 percent from a year earlier to $136.3 billion, topping Wall Street projections. Traffic at U.S. stores was up 1.6 percent, and the average shopper's ticket value grew 1 percent.
Same-store sales in the U.S. were up 2.6 percent, an increase for the 14th-consecutive quarter and higher than a projected rise of 2.2 percent. Same-stores sales of Walmart's wholesale Sam's Club division were up 2.4 percent, while nine of Walmart's 11 international business segments reported same-store sales growth during the latest period.
Online sales grew just 23 percent during the period, much slower than the prior quarter 's 50 percent jump. It has been more than a year since Walmart acquired Jet.com, which gave the company an initial boost.
""Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely,"" CEO Doug McMillon said on a conference call with analysts and investors. ""Including online grocery, it has been the key driver of our e-commerce growth and that will continue.""
Walmart has set its fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share forecast at $4.75 to $5. Same-store sales at Walmart U.S. stores are expected to climb at least 2 percent, while those at Sam's Club locations could rise as much as 4 percent. E-commerce sales are forecast to grow roughly 40 percent in the coming year.
""We're going to continue expanding our e-commerce businesses as it relates to food ... with online grocery ramping up,"" McMillon explained. ""So we think by the time we get to the end of the year, and look back at the number for the total year, [e-commerce sales] will be approximately 40 percent.""
Walmart is preparing to unveil a revamped website this year, with a focus on fashion and home goods. The company will partner with Lord & Taylor to sell the Hudson's Bay -owned chain's merchandise on Walmart.com, as it continues to expand its offerings on Jet.com (which include Uniquely J, Modcloth and Bonobos).
Just last week, Walmart began rolling out new apparel lines , adding to its online merchandise mix. The private labels are one way Walmart can boost its margins, when it's been forced to cut prices on other items such as electronics and appliances.
The retailer has endured a number of changes of late to its operating structure, inventory and leadership to compete further against Amazon.
For Walmart, news of starting wage increases and bonuses in January was abruptly followed by Sam's Club store closures , followed by layoffs at its headquarters and cutbacks of store co-managers. The company has been remodeling its stores across the U.S. to focus more on grocery and online order fulfillment.
""We still believe Walmart has more work to do to widen its e-commerce customer base,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said in response to Tuesday's earnings report.
""There are many demographics, especially younger and professional segments, for whom Walmart is not the destination of choice online,"" Saunders added. ""This is a tough nut for Walmart to crack, and one that it can only break by more heavily marketing its services and proposition.""
Including Tuesday's losses, Walmart shares have risen about 35 percent from a year ago. As of Friday's market close (Monday being a holiday), the stock was up more than 50 percent.",2018-02-20T12:36:00.000+02:00

2061,Walmart’s plunge this week shows investors should be skeptical of big growth after deals,"Tweet 
Wall Street is prone to making errors over-extrapolating growth trends. Analysts made this mistake on their Walmart online sales predictions this week. 
The retailer’s shareholders fell victim to elevated expectations as the company’s e-commerce sales growth, previously boosted by its Jet.com acquisition, waned. 
Walmart’s shares plunged 13 percent in the two trading sessions after the retailer reported fourth-quarter financials Tuesday morning. Its online sales grew just 23 percent year-over-year during the quarter ending in January, down from the prior quarter’s 50 percent increase. In comparison, Amazon’s sales rose 38 percent in its latest quarter. 
Analysts covering Walmart were stunned over the results. 
Walmart’s “slowdown in digital sales is a bit perplexing,” Gordon Haskett’s Chuck Grom wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Baird’s Peter Benedict also wrote the retailer’s “slowdown in e-commerce sales was more material than expected” the same day. 
Perhaps Wall Street should have been more skeptical over Walmart’s previous acquisition-fueled online sales numbers. The retailer acquired e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in Sept. 2016, which benefited the company’s e-commerce growth the past year. 
Walmart did not break out the specific incremental revenue numbers or percent of sales that came from the acquisition, making it difficult for investors to figure out the true apples-to-apples year-over-year growth figures. 
Even though analysts knew Jet.com’s sales added to Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth, many analysts gushed over retailer’s online sales numbers last year anyway. 
Baird’s Benedict said the retailer had proven its ability to compete with Amazon in November as a result of the growth numbers. 
Walmart is “becoming a powerful omni-channel force,” he wrote in November. “Efforts to broaden the online assortment, improve the customer value proposition (free two-day shipping, pick-up discounts on non-store items), and enhance convenience have helped fuel the impressive ramp in U.S. e-commerce sales growth.” 
He wasn’t alone in his praise. Citi Research’s Kate McShane upgraded the retailer’s shares in December. 
“Walmart’s e-commerce operations are emerging as a true challenger to Amazon,” she wrote. 
But Walmart’s January quarter online sales growth deceleration, more than one full year after the Jet.com deal, proved the hyper-growth numbers were mainly due to the acquisition. 
The retailer admitted the “majority” of the drop in sales growth was due to its Jet.com business fully passing its one-year acquisition anniversary. 
“Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23 percent, down from 50 percent in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition as well as creating a healthier long-term foundation for holiday,” Walmart said during Tuesday’s conference call with investors. “A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected, as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth.” 
Investors and analysts should be skeptical when companies generate stunning business growth numbers after significant acquisitions. The metrics may not be an accurate portrayal of the long-term sustainable growth rates of a business. 
When asked for comment a Walmart spokesperson sent this statement: 
“Overall, we finished the year with eCommerce sales growth of more than 40 percent. So, we feel better about the year than the quarter. 
Looking ahead, we expect eCommerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the new year with about 40 percent growth for the year. Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including online grocery, is and has been the key driver of our eCommerce growth, and that will continue. The Jet brand over-indexed with higher income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition and we intend to build on that strength going forward. The cost to acquire a new customer on a nation-wide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we’ve been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet except in certain urban markets. Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in the early days but it will be well-positioned where we’ve chosen to focus the brand.”",2018-02-23T22:57:00.000+02:00

5393,Fed: Investors taking market volatility 'in stride',"GDP outlook Fed: Investors taking market volatility 'in stride' ""Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month's turbulence in stride,"" the Fed's meeting minutes released Wednesday said. Fed officials blamed rising inflation and valuations for the market's 10 percent correction this year. CNBC.com Getty Images Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference March 21, 2018 in Washington, DC. 
Along with pretty much all of Wall Street, Federal Reserve officials have been watching stock market volatility with a careful eye. 
Their conclusion, at least so far: It's not been much of a big deal. 
Minutes from the Fed's March meeting indicate that central bankers believe concerns about rising inflation and valuations provided an early-February jolt that sent the market into a 10 percent correction. 
However, in talking to field contacts, it seems the psychological damage was minimal. 
""Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month's turbulence in stride, although a few participants suggested that financial developments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with still-high valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally,"" the meeting summary said. 
The market has continued to be on an up-and-down trajectory since the early February upset, briefly entering another corrective phase amid worries over a potential trade war between the U.S. and China. 
The Fed minutes addressed mainly the initial plunge when January inflation numbers were higher than expected and average hourly earnings also posted a surprise jump. 
Officials also noted the collapse of low-volatility trades that had been highly profitable before the correction. 
""Some reports suggested that the increase in volatility was amplified by the unwinding of trading positions based on various types of volatility trading strategies,"" the minutes said. 
Finally, they also noted that there was market concern over the economy being allowed to run hot while the Fed continued to remain dovish. That could ""pose risks to financial stability,"" the minutes said.",2018-04-11T21:10:00.000+03:00

Penney also announced a management shakeup and said it is cutting 360 positions , including at its corporate headquarters, to save as much as $25 million a year. 
J.C. Penney's stock was down about 12 percent Friday morning on the news. 
Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, compared with what analysts were expecting based on a Thomson Reuters survey: 
* Earnings per share: 57 cents, adjusted, vs. 47 cents expected. 
* Revenue: $4.03 billion vs. $4.05 billion. 
* Same-store sales: 2.6 percent growth vs. an increase of 2.9 percent. 
Net income totaled $254 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $192 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. The company reported a $75 million benefit during the fourth quarter from new U.S. tax legislation. 
Excluding one-time items, Penney said it earned 57 cents a share, 10 cents above Street estimates. 
Revenue increased 1.8 percent during the period to $4.03 billion, slightly short of analysts' forecast. 
Same-store sales, a key metric, rose 2.6 percent, while analysts were calling for 2.9 percent growth. 
Penney's ongoing turnaround efforts include liquidating excess apparel inventory, closing unprofitable stores and growing its private-label lines. Last quarter, those investments appeared to be paying off, as Penney's same-store sales climbed nearly 2 percent ahead of the holidays, surpassing analysts' expectations. 
On Friday, though, investors feared Penney's latest successes could be waning. Its quarterly results were sharply lower than stronger reports this week from rivals Macy's and Kohl's , and its outlook for the current year was troubling. 
Looking to fiscal 2018, Penney said it expects to earn 5 cents to 25 cents per share, largely below analysts' average expectation of 20 cents. 
""In 2018, we will intensify our market share efforts in Appliances, Mattresses and Furniture, while continuing to take steps to modernize our apparel assortment and omni-channel,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement. Omnichannel is a multichannel approach to shopping that aims to provide shoppers with a seamless experience, whether they're buying online or in stores. 
Penney has managed to gain market share of appliances as Sears Holdings closes more stores. It has also seen consistent growth in its beauty department, which includes hair salons, Sephora makeup stores and fine jewelry. 
""J.C. Penney is the only retailer that can offer our customers a total beauty solution, combining Sephora, salon and fine jewelry under the same roof,"" Ellison said Friday on a call with analysts and investors. ""This unique beauty experience cannot be replicated online."" 
To be sure, the company still has other obstacles as a mall-based retailer trying to adjust to sales moving online. Penney recently announced it would be closing one of its distribution centers , eliminating more than 600 jobs. The company has said it will close eight stores in total in 2018, compared with more than 100 closures the year prior. 
On Friday, Penney confirmed its plans to cut 130 roles at its corporate headquarters, along with 230 positions from within its stores. Other workers in stores will be reallocated to more customer-facing positions, the company explained, to simplify operations and oversee omnichannel initiatives. 
""It is imperative that we maintain a thoughtful approach to managing expenses, while effectively supporting the needs of the business,"" Ellison said. 
Regarding the management changes, the company said Mike Amend, executive vice president of Penney's omnichannel business, is leaving. It said Therace Risch will assume the omnichannel responsibilities as chief information and chief digital officer. 
In addition, Joe McFarland will become Penney's chief customer officer and will lead merchandising and store operations. McFarland and Risch will report to Ellison. 
Including Friday's losses, J.C. Penney shares have climbed a little more than 8 percent so far this year.",2018-03-02T13:03:00.000+02:00
6164,Leading indicators up for sixth straight month,"5 Hours Ago | 00:46
A composite index of leading economic indicators gained for the sixth straight month in April.
The Conference Board 's Leading Economic Index gained 0.4 percent to 109.4, matching expectations from economists polled by Reuters.
""In April, stock prices and housing permits were the only negative contributors, whereas the labor market components, which made negative contributions in March, improved,"" said Director of Business Cycles and Growth Research at The Conference Board Ataman Ozyildirim.
The measure, which measures 10 key metrics of economic movement, jumped 0.3 percent to 109 in March, which followed a gain of 0.7 percent in February.
The index is used to forecast global economic trends and take checks on the U.S. economy. The Conference Board, a business research association, determines a composite value based on 10 key metrics, including manufacturers' new orders, stock prices and average weekly unemployment claims, to create the composite value.
""April's increase and continued uptrend in the U.S. LEI suggest solid growth should continue in the second half of 2018,"" Ozyildirim said. ""However, the LEI's six-month growth rate has recently moderated somewhat, suggesting growth is unlikely to strongly accelerate.""",2018-05-17T17:00:00.000+03:00
646,"A 10 to 15% stock market correction is virtually unavoidable, Blackstone's Byron Wien warns","Published 8 Hours Ago CNBC.com 
The early days of 2018 may be pointing to another monster year for gains, but Wall Street legend Byron Wien believes the rally is in a danger zone. 
Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Private Wealth Solutions, is warning investors that a 10 to 15 percent stock market pullback is virtually unavoidable. 
""Sentiment is bordering on the euphoric state. When investors think they can't get into trouble, they usually do,"" Wien said Wednesday on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" ""We're vulnerable to a correction."" 
Wien's comments came as stocks failed to extend their six-day win streak. The Dow , S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed lower for the first time this year. Bond yields set another round of multiyear highs — which could indicate inflation could emerge as a headwind. 
""The market needs to have some kind of correction. There are some excesses in it. So I fully expect it to happen,"" he said. 
But Wien, who detects frothiness among technology stocks in particular, predicts the markets would recover quickly. 
""The year will end higher than it started no matter what happens along the way,"" he said, adding that he'd ""absolutely buy"" stocks on a correction because underlying fundamentals remain strong. 
Ultimately, he sees the S&P 500 in 2018 ending 9 percent higher than current levels as long as the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3 percent. 
For now, Wien is shifting his investment strategy to the overseas markets.

3890,'60 Minutes' Stormy Daniels interview was its most-watched episode in 10 years,"The ""60 Minutes"" interview with Stormy Daniels about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump brought in the show's highest ratings in 10 years.
About 22.1 million people tuned into Sunday's episode which also featured a profile of NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo, according to CBS .
The show achieved a 16.3 rating and a 27 share in the 56 Nielsen metered markets. Using Nielsen's estimates from the 2017-18 TV season , that would be approximately 19.5 million households. The episode was its best metered performance in a decade, topped only by the first post-election interview with President-elect Barack Obama and Michelle Obama in 2008. A ratings point is 1 percent of the total number of households, according to the U.S. Census Bureau and Nielsen's national TV panel. The figures for the current season are released every August.
During the sit-down segment with Anderson Cooper, Daniels recounted her alleged one-time sexual relationship with Trump . Daniels, an adult film star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, also told Cooper how she was threatened by an unknown man in a Las Vegas parking lot to stop talking about the encounter. She said she was with her infant daughter at the time. Daniels said she signed a nondisclosure agreement with Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen over fears for her safety.
CBS' ""60 Minutes"" landed the interview after Daniels and her lawyer Michael Avenatti directly reached out to the show . Avenatti was previously interviewed on ""60 Minutes"" for his case against Halyard Health and Kimberly-Clark, as well as another case against a California cemetery his clients alleged were desecrating remains. Cooper and ""60 Minutes"" producer Andy Court had worked on those previous stories as well.
Daniels and Avenatti said she was offered as much as $1 million by other outlets to tell her story, but decided to go with the news program for free in order to tell her side of the story through a reputable organization.

3556,Trump wants a 'phase two' of tax cuts,"Trump wants a 'phase two' of tax cuts President Trump again brings up a ""phase two"" of tax cuts. The GOP law passed in December permanently chops taxes for corporations and temporarily reduces the tax rate for most individuals. 4 Hours Ago | 03:34 
President Donald Trump said again Monday he wants a ""phase two"" of tax cuts on top of the law Republicans passed in December. 
Speaking as the World Series champion Houston Astros visited the White House, Trump asked Rep. Kevin Brady , R-Texas, whether he planned to cut taxes further. Brady and GOP Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz were among the lawmakers from Texas attending the event. 
""Kevin, are we going for an additional tax cut, I understand?"" Trump asked, drawing laughter from those gathered for the event. ""Huh? He's the king of those tax cuts, yeah? We're going to do a phase two, I'm hearing that. You hear that, John and Ted? Phase two. We're actually very serious about that, Kevin. So, it's good."" 
Trump previously joked about ""phase two"" while speaking to GOP lawmakers in February . Joshua Roberts | Reuters President Donald Trump waves as he arrives to speak in support of Republican congressional candidate Rick Sacconne during a Make America Great Again rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, U.S., March 10, 2018. 
The law passed in December permanently chopped the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and temporarily reduced taxes on most individuals. The plan sparked concerns about growing budget deficits. Now there are questions about the technical glitches and loopholes left by the hastily passed plan. 
If Trump and Republicans seriously pursue more tax reductions, it would spark more questions about how to offset the lost revenues. When they passed the bill in December, Senate Republicans did so by the narrowest of margins under special budget rules requiring only a simple majority. It is unclear whether congressional Republican leaders are serious about further tax cuts. WATCH: Trump says massive tax cuts seeing tremendous results show chapters",2018-03-12T19:14:00.000+02:00

Best Buy stock slipped Thursday after a top retail brokerage firm downgraded shares on fears that Wall Street has already priced in the store's rebound. 
Telsey Advisory Group cut its rating to market perform from outperform, sending shares sliding 1.3 percent. 
""The low hanging fruit has already been picked, and going forward, the company is increasing investments in technology, labor, and supply chain to maintain its leadership position,"" Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman wrote to clients. ""The overall product cycle remains average in 2018, with no highly-anticipated launches. Smart-home devices and appliances remain growth areas, while we anticipate weaker trends in computing and mobile phones."" 
Feldman added that given Best Buy's impressive performance in 2017, the new year will likely make for challenging same-store sales comparisons — a closely watched metric in retail. He anticipates same-store sales of -1.5 percent in the second quarter and -1 percent in the third quarter. 
Best Buy shares are up roughly 70 percent the last 12 months after the retailer showed there still may be a place for an in-store experience with electronics. 
The analyst's new 12-month price target of $81 represents 5 percent upside from Wednesday's close.

1267,2017 was one of Earth's warmest years on record even without El Nino,"2017 was one of Earth's warmest years on record even without El Nino 2017 was the second-warmest year on record, NASA said Thursday. A NOAA report using different methods said 2017 was Earth's third-warmest year. Cris Faga | NurPhoto | Getty Images People at swimming pools in São Paulo, Brazil on a hot winter day last September. 
Earth had one of its warmest years on record in 2017, according to two new analyses from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
A report from NASA released Thursday said 2017 was the second-warmest year on record, while another NOAA report that used different methods said 2017 was the third-warmest year. 
Both agencies are in ""strong agreement"" that the data indicate a long-term warming trend around the world. 
Despite cold weather in certain parts of the world, overall the planet has been rapidly warming over the last four decades, said NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director Gavin Schmidt. 
2016 was the planet's warmest year since record-keeping began in 1880, and climate scientists attributed that in part to a strong El Nino Southern Oscillation climate pattern. 
But El Nino was not behind the warm temperatures in 2017. 
NASA's release said the rise in Earth's temperature over the long term has been ""driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.""",2018-01-18T18:17:00.000+02:00
1899,BlackRock pro: ETFs did 'better than they ever performed' during market swoon,"CNBC.com Dowell | Getty Images 
Exchange-traded products weathered perhaps their biggest challenge yet during the recent market decline and came through relatively unscathed despite some searing headlines. 
A very specific type of product called an exchange-traded note took much of the market focus during the decline. That group suffered huge losses after a sustained bet against volatility suddenly blew up. 
Ultimately, though, ETNs make up a very small part of the market. While watching at least one of the so-called low-vol funds blow up was stunning, it had little overall impact on the market, which over the past two sessions, including Monday, had made up a good deal of the previous losses . 
The Dow industrials saw their biggest single-day point drop in history last week as the Cboe Volatility index, or VIX , spiked and investors worried about more damage to come. show chapters 2:38 PM ET Fri, 9 Feb 2018 | 04:22 
""We just saw the largest-ever percent gain in the VIX and the largest-ever single-day point fall in the Dow. ETFs performed better than they've ever performed,"" said Martin Small, head of U.S. iShares at money manager BlackRock. ""They've become an integral part in risk management and hedging."" 
BlackRock is the biggest player in the ETF market, managing nearly $1.4 trillion of the industry's $3.4 trillion in assets under its iShares umbrella. 
The firm pointedly last week released a statement reminding investors that it does not offer the type of exchange-traded product that generated so much talk around the market. The short-vol notes are part of a $50 billion sliver of the total ETF space that uses leverage to bet for or against certain indexes and strategies, often providing double, triple or in a few cases quadruple the returns of the underlying index. 
""They're completely different than traditional exchange-traded funds,"" Small said. ""They use financial engineering, and in a stressed market they don't perform the way many investors would intuit for them to perform."" 
The issues with the short-vol and leverage funds come amid a heated contest between active and passive strategies. 
Active managers, seeking to stem a powerful influx of funds into ETFs over the past several years, have tried to paint the competition as landmines ready to blow during sell-offs of the type that occurred in February. They argue that investors who believe they have diversification because they own index funds are actually betting on just a handful of stocks that move those indexes. 
Indeed, when an index like the S&P 500 tumbles and holders of, for instance, the $256 billion SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF run for the doors, the individual components will sell off as well. That's what happened last week — but that is what's supposed to happen. 
""When that happens, you get the classic risk-off-everything sell-off,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, who has been on top of ETF trends since the industry was in its infancy. ""There is no differentiation, and correlation spikes as a result."" 
Others express more serious concerns, namely that managers of the indexes won't be able to keep up with redemptions in times of heavy market stress. 
""I'm particularly worried right now about a potential liquidity crisis that is deriving in the ETF market, when we're seeing not only the inverse volatility ETF structures being disrupted, but we're starting to see real flights from the ETF market,"" Daniel J. Arbess, Xerion Investments CEO, told CNBC. 
While Arbess alleged that the SPDR S&P 500, or SPY, was getting ""backed up in meeting its redemption requests"" and not accurately tracking the index, Small said, ""if anything we've seen the opposite"" in overall ETF transactions. The SPY fund appeared to be trading in close line with the S&P 500 Monday afternoon. 
""Every time I read something about ETFs or an index impacting the market, I look to see if anybody has delivered numbers and supporting facts,"" Small said. ""There are no numbers or supporting facts."" 
Interestingly, while the S&P Trust fund was the biggest loser in investor outflows over the past week, at $23.1 billion, its BlackRock counterpart, the iShares Core S&P 500 , saw the biggest inflows of any stock-focused ETF, with $1.1 billion. 
Still, investors have grown leery of ETFs, at least in the near term. 
During last week's brutal volatility, investors pulled $29 billion out of stock-focused funds, with inflows for all other sectors about even. Still, year-to-date, ETFs have seen $28.1 billion of inflows, according to FactSet. 
That continues a powerful trend. For all of 2017 investors put $691.6 billion into passive funds, which mostly entails the ETF space, while pulling just shy of $7 billion from active. The numbers are even more pronounced for U.S. equity funds — $220.3 billion of inflows vs. $207.5 billion in outflows, respectively.

4658,Cramer recalls his own two crash landings in airplanes after Southwest's tragic engine failure,"Pilots and cabin crew deserve much more credit for their bravery in emergency airline situations such as the Southwest Airlines engine failure that resulted in one passenger's death, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday.
""I've been in two crash landings in my life ... where there were no wheels,"" said Cramer, who declined to name the airlines involved in those incidents. ""And the coolness of the pilots, the coolness of the stewards ... these people were amazing.""
""These people deserve a lot of credit,"" Cramer told CNBC's "" Squawk on the Street. "" ""Both times, I was reassured quickly. One of them was a faux landing, and it bounced, bounced, bounced and finally the last bounce right at the end of the runway.""
The NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the blown jet engine that set off a terrifying in-flight chain of events Tuesday. Debris from the engine shattered a passenger's window, and a businesswoman was nearly sucked out of the plane through the hole. She later died.
The plane, a Boeing 737-700, was carrying 149 people on a flight from New York's La Guardia Airport to Dallas when it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.
The pilot landing the damaged plane was Tammie Jo Shults, one the first female fighter pilots in the U.S. military, according to The Associated Press. She is being praised for her calming presence while trying to land the plane and for her "" nerves of steel .""
A preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of ""metal fatigue,"" according to the NTSB. Southwest said that it is accelerating its inspections of the engine type that was involved in the accident and that they will likely be completed within 30 days.

2734,Trump treads lightly around the NRA as he pushes for tighter gun rules after Florida massacre,"President Donald Trump , who ran as a gun-rights advocate, has started to publicly discuss tighter restrictions on firearms following the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school.
So far he has proceeded carefully, balancing a desire to take action with a desire to keep his political base happy. This week, the president has pushed mostly for modest steps already backed by the National Rifle Association — which is a powerful influence among gun owners in many of the areas that propelled Trump to the presidency.
While Trump's support gives Republicans in Congress more cover to pass narrow gun control measures, it is unclear what action lawmakers will take following the latest in a string of mass shootings, including last week's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Pressure has increased this week amid widely followed protests and calls for action from students at the school.
Trump may provide more detail on his gun control stance on Wednesday afternoon. The president is scheduled to host a listening session with students, teachers and parents involved in the Florida shooting as well as the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.
On Tuesday, Trump signed a memorandum recommending that Attorney General Jeff Sessions propose rules banning so-called bump stocks , which can effectively turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. The gunman who massacred more than 50 people at a concert in Las Vegas last year used such a device.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also told reporters Trump is open to supporting a bipartisan Senate bill to close holes in the current background check system . It aims to make federal agencies better at following rules that require them to submit criminal convictions to the FBI, which could help stop high-risk individuals from getting guns.
Last year, the Air Force said it had not submitted records that could have stopped the shooter who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, from buying a gun.
""Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Trump tweet
After the Vegas massacre, the NRA said it backed a ban on bump stocks . The organization's legislative arm also signaled its support for the background check policy — though as part of a broader House-passed bill that would allow individuals who have concealed carry permits in one state to carry nationwide.
The White House has also publicly or privately floated some gun rules that could draw the NRA's ire.
On Tuesday, Sanders did not rule out Trump's support for an assault weapons ban, saying ""we haven't closed the door on any front."" The gunman in Florida and multiple other mass shooters have used some variation of a semi-automatic rifle like the AR-15.
The NRA opposes the policy. The organization tweeted a link Tuesday saying a previous assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 did not contribute to a decrease in crime.
NRA tweet
A 2004 report commissioned by the Justice Department's research arm, however, concluded that the effects of a 1994 ban were ""mixed"" and ""still unfolding"" at the time it expired, according to FactCheck.org.
While the ban reduced crimes with assault weapons, the use of other, still legal semi-automatic weapons with large-capacity magazines increased, the report said. Therefore, the report stopped short of attributing a drop in U.S. gun violence to the assault weapons ban.
On Tuesday, Sanders also said age restrictions for buying rifles like the AR-15 are ""on the table."" The NRA's legislative arm did not immediately comment on where it stood on possible age restrictions.
Where Congress goes from here Two pieces of gun legislation may see a vote in Congress: the bill to strengthen background checks, and a proposal to ban bump stocks. As of now, the background check legislation appears to have more traction.
Congress is on recess this week and cannot take any immediate action. It is unclear what can get done this year, as many lawmakers will spend large chunks of the year outside of Washington campaigning for November's midterm elections.
Champions of the background check bill, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn , R-Texas, and Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn., cheered Trump's decision to support it this week. It appears to have the support to pass at least the Senate as a stand-alone bill. Senate Democrats would likely oppose the concealed carry reciprocity proposal approved by the House.
Bump stock legislation may have a tougher path than the background check bill because it so far has not gained as much bipartisan momentum. Any rule to ban the devices put forth by the Justice Department could face legal challenges and may only serve as a temporary fix.
Murphy, who previously represented the congressional district where 20 children and six adults were killed at school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, argued this week that the bipartisan background check bill alone does not go far enough.
Murphy tweet
Gun control policy could feature in the fight for control of Congress in November. Republicans, who have often cautioned against new gun regulations after mass shootings, will try to hold their edge in both chambers of Congress.
Democrats, who generally favor more restrictions on guns, will attempt to win majorities in both the House and Senate.
A Quinnipiac poll released Tuesday found two-thirds of American voters favored tighter gun restrictions . Among its findings, it said 97 percent of voters back universal background checks and 67 percent of voters support an assault weapons ban.

189,Phew! Delta and American agree to fly each other's stranded passengers,"The two largest U.S. airlines have found an ally to prevent passengers from getting stranded: Each other.
American Airlines , the biggest U.S. carrier, and the No. 2 airline, Delta , on Wednesday are resuming an agreement that allows the airlines to rebook their passengers on each other's flights during travel disruptions.
The decision comes after costly and highly visible travel chaos in recent years, from computer failures to power outages to bad weather , all made more noticeable to the public through social media.
Delta and American had an agreement until 2015 that allowed them to rebook each other's passengers. Delta said that so-called interline agreement was scrapped after more American passengers were sent to Delta than vice versa.
show chapters Are airline stocks set to soar on earnings?      22 Hours Ago | 03:04 ""At that rate the industry agreement was no longer mutually beneficial,"" Eric Phillips, Delta's senior vice president of revenue management, said in September 2015, when that agreement was halted.
@ AmericanAir (2/3) so basically you've forced my hand and I've had to pay out of pocket to get on a Delta flight (since you won't book the people you've screwed on another airline with availability!) because I need to get to LAX today instead of >24 hrs later 
The new agreement stops short of a traditional interline pact because it won't allow travel agencies to book itineraries that include both airlines.
""This is strictly an irregular-operations ticketing and baggage reaccommodation agreement,"" said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant. ""A true interline means things like fare combinability for travel agency and third-party sales. That's not what this is.""
Both Delta and American have similar agreements with other airlines, such as United . 
The new agreement is ""a tool that will give our employees more options to reaccommodate customers whose flights are canceled during weather and other uncommon scenarios when Delta flights are canceled,"" Durrant said.
The agreement could end up both saving airlines money and tamping down social-media outcry during travel disruptions, instead of having passengers stranded and possibly due compensation.
While the agreement will allow airlines to ticket passengers on the other's planes, ""our priority will be always to keep customers on American or our alliance and joint-business partners,"" said American spokesman Matt Miller.

Published 9 Hours Ago Reuters Heinz-Peter Bader | Reuters Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih listens during a news conference after an OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, November 30, 2017. 
Saudi Arabia hopes OPEC and its allies will be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the current supply cut deal ends this year, its oil minister said on Saturday. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. 
The pact, aimed at propping oil prices, began in January 2017 and will run until the end of 2018.

Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies were committed to bringing balance and stability to the market and that he hoped it would be possible to ease output curbs next year. 
""A study is taking place and once we know exactly what balancing the market will entail we will announce what is the next step. The next step may be easing of the production constraints,"" he told reporters in New Delhi. 
""My estimation is that it will happen sometime in 2019. But we don't know when and we don't know how"". 
Falih said OPEC was determined to translate the success of the deal to curb supply into a permanent framework with other major producers.

Falih said compliance with the output cuts in January was ""exceptional."" 
Oil prices have doubled from their lows in 2015-2016 after the cuts. 
Falih said the market had absorbed rising U.S. shale oil production, as output from countries such as Venezuela and Mexico had declined. 
U.S. oil inventories fell last week. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, in March cut production and exported less than 7 million bpd due to seasonally soft demand. 
Falih said that in January-March, Saudi Arabia's oil production was well below the production cap, with exports averaging below 7 million bpd. India focus 
State oil company Saudi Aramco has signed a preliminary deal to invest in India's planned 1.2 million bpd West Coast refinery. Falih said Aramco was also looking at buying stakes in existing major refiners and expansion projects in India. 
He did not specify the size of stake Aramco will take in the west coast refinery, but added ""the more the better."" 
India aims to expand its refining capacity by 77 percent to about 8.8 million bpd by 2030. 
Falih said Saudi Arabia would also sign oil supply deals as part of the agreement to buy stakes in Indian refineries, a strategy the kingdom has adopted to expand its market share in Asia and fend off rivals.

2047,Most of Spotify's investors can cash out at any time,"Among the many things that distinguish Spotify's upcoming share sale from a typical IPO, there's this gift for existing investors: they can cash out whenever they want.
The music-streaming company filed for its offering on Wednesday without the inclusion of underwriters. It will also lack a traditional 180-day lock-up period, when major investors are typically forbidden from selling their shares to avoid flooding the market.
""Consequently, any of our shareholders, including our directors and officers who own our ordinary shares and other significant shareholders, may sell any or all of their ordinary shares at any time (subject to any restrictions under applicable law), including immediately upon listing,"" the company said.
The one exception is Chinese internet company Tencent , which owns 7.5 percent of Spotify's ordinary shares. According to the filing, affiliates of Tencent (and TME — Tencent Music Entertainment Group), agreed not to sell ordinary shares for a period of three years from Dec. 15, 2017. 
Spotify CEO Daniel Ek , who owns 25.7 percent, and co-founder Martin Lorentzon, who owns 13.2 percent, aren't subject to that agreement. Nor is Tiger Global (6.9 percent), Sony (5.7 percent), or Technology Crossover Ventures (5.4 percent).
show chapters Spotify to list IPO at NYSE      1 Hour Ago | 01:04 When a lock-up period ends, it can spur significant volatility for a stock — just ask Snap . Even though CEO Evan Spiegel promised not to sell shares for the full year after the IPO, the stock fell in late July and early August as the lock-up expired.
Insider sales also might stoke fears in the market that the company's core backers don't believe in its future prospects.
The absence of a lock-up period is one of the four risks Spotify cited in its section related to the risks owning ordinary shares. The other potential concerns are that there won't be any underwriters or a given price range, there won't be a fixed number of shares for sale and there won't be a roadshow to market the offering. 
""Such differences from an underwritten initial public offering could result in a volatile market price for our ordinary shares and uncertain trading volume and may adversely affect your ability to sell your ordinary shares,"" the company said.
(Clarification: A previous version of this story referenced Spotify's planned $1 billion offering. While the company included that number in the filing, we've removed it because it's just a placeholder.)",2018-02-28T22:58:00.000+02:00
2558,Fake news video on Florida school shooting briefly becomes top trending video on YouTube,"MSNBC David Hogg The top trending video on YouTube Wednesday morning advanced a burgeoning conspiracy theory that a survivor of last week's shooting at a Florida high school was a ""crisis actor.""
maxwell tweet
By 11 a.m. ET, the video had been removed from YouTube — but could still be viewed on other sites.
""This video should never have appeared in Trending. Because the video contained footage from an authoritative news source, our system misclassified it. As soon as we became aware of the video, we removed it from Trending and from YouTube for violating our policies. We are working to improve our systems moving forward,"" a YouTube spokesperson told CNBC.
Mary deBree, Head of Content Policy at Facebook, also said in statement that ""we are removing this content from Facebook.""
Similar videos and links also flooded Facebook and Google on Wednesday, some garnering tens of thousands of shares.
Grimes tweet
Facebook and Google searches for ""crisis actor"" or the student's name, ""David Hogg,"" return a mix of links: Some legitimate news sources citing Hogg's denial of the claim, and some spreading the false report.
A search for Hogg's name on YouTube also revealed that some of those false reports could still be found on the site Wednesday afternoon.
The term ""crisis actor"" is sometimes defined as an actor who goes from crisis to crisis to advance a certain ideology.
CNBC searched ""David Hogg"" in Google News just before noon Wednesday, and found false reports listed as ""Related Coverage"" alongside legitimate reports.
It shows that major tech companies are still unable to keep false news items off their platforms, despite the avalanche of criticism they've been hit with since the 2016 election.
Facebook and Google faced similar challenges in November when a gunman opened fire on the crowd at a Las Vegas concert and false reports appeared on the sites .
The companies at the time said they work to curtail the spread of misinformation.

1082,Cramer's game plan: JP Morgan set the benchmark. Now watch the banks,"After hours of marveling at the tape's incessant march higher, CNBC's Jim Cramer took a step back to check the market layout.
""What's driving it? ... Same as always: [a] stock shortage — it's really been acute in the industrials — 401(k) money being thrown at the market, animal spirits, a stronger consumer, tax reform, deregulation and a general revaluation higher,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said. ""Who's doing the leading? Once again, it's Boeing , it's Caterpillar , it's Adobe , it's Alphabet , it's Apple , and it's Netflix .""
Certainly, the layout can change. On Friday, shares of frequent market leader Facebook were taken down after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to change its News Feed to promote ""meaningful social interactions.""
But Facebook's 4 percent decline failed to jolt the broader market. Instead, a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan propelled its stock and the market to new highs , erasing worries that one-time charges would make the numbers look worse than expected.
""J.P. Morgan's a terrific place to actually start the discussion for next week's game plan because it did set a benchmark that other banks, which all report next week, I think are going to find hard to beat,"" Cramer said.
With that in mind, the ""Mad Money"" host turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching next week:
Tuesday: Citigroup, UnitedHealth, CSX Citigroup : Citigroup's chief financial officer said in December that the bank could take a $20 billion hit because of the newly passed tax law , which could weigh on its Tuesday morning earnings report.
""I believe its buyback has been so aggressive that the company will actually still end up showing some excellent earnings growth, even as it's clear from J.P. Morgan's numbers that fixed income trading — a big revenue generator for both J.P. Morgan and Citi — was much worse than even thought,"" Cramer said. ""Citi will be hard-pressed to top J.P. Morgan, but it's no slouch.""
UnitedHealth : Cramer expected ""still one more blowout quarter"" from the massive health insurer, packed with insight from its rapidly growing data-driven business.
CSX : Railroad operator CSX will report its earnings after the bell. Shares of the transport play have recovered bountifully since its late CEO Hunter Harrison passed away in December, but Cramer wasn't sold on the stock.
""If the rails have a weak link, it will be CSX because it has run so much,"" he said.
Wednesday: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, ASML Holdings Bank of America : Bank of America may not have J.P. Morgan's global ""tentacles,"" but with the largest deposit base in the United States, it's the top beneficiary of rising interest rates , Cramer said ahead of its Wednesday earnings report.
Goldman Sachs : Cramer was hopeful that Goldman would find a way to deliver a positive earnings report despite lower than expected trading volumes in the fourth quarter.
""It's a much more trading-oriented investment bank, and lately, the markets have lacked the kind of volatility that translates into terrific profits,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned here, though, that [CEO] Lloyd Blankfein , who's steered the bank through the hardest of times, may decide to hang up his spurs and devote the rest of his life to charity, which would be par for this incredibly good man's course. I say, not yet, please.""
ASML : Cramer wanted this oft-overlooked semiconductor equipment maker's earnings report to give investors more details on whether there's too much new semiconductor capacity on the market.
""If we hear that orders are through the roof from this equipment maker or that anyone's canceling them because they've been through the roof, I could see the commodity chipmakers like Micron disappointing with some weak stock action,"" he said.
Thursday: Morgan Stanley, PPG Industries, IBM Morgan Stanley : Cramer didn't envy Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman for having to report earnings after the rest of the big banks set the bar.
""I think [the results will] be excellent. But by this point, will anybody really care?"" Cramer wondered. ""Aren't we more likely to see a wave of profit-taking once all the big banks have reported? You know what, that's actually a reasonable bet. Let's keep our eyes open.""
PPG : Industrial coatings maker PPG will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer expected a good report.
""I also think [PPG] could be on the verge of a value-enhancing merger,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""If I owned it, I would certainly stay long. If it gets weak earlier this week, I would buy it.""
IBM : Cramer advised investors to listen to IBM's conference call, led by CFO Martin Schroeter, before reacting to the computer giant's after-the-bell earnings report.
""[The headline numbers] can often be hard to understand until Schroeter explains them,"" he said. ""[IBM] just started a new mainframe cycle and that, historically, has been good news for the company. Plus, Warren Buffett seems to have stopped selling shares, thank heavens, and that's good news for the stock.""
Friday: Schlumberger Oilfield service company Schlumberger will report earnings on Friday coupled with one of Cramer's favorite conference calls in the industry.
Since Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard called oil's bottom last quarter, the price of crude has rocketed to multi-year highs , so Cramer was eager to hear his insights.
Final thoughts ""Here's the bottom line: you have to respect the fact that we're in a once-in-a-lifetime move where even when a mega-cap stock like Facebook gets slammed, it has no pin action whatsoever on the rest of the market,"" Cramer said. ""You know what we've got here, don't you? We've got a beast. Still, on Tuesday, the beast is going to come in real hungry after a couple days off. I bet it gets fed once again.""

474,"Head of esports scholarship program is bullish on competitive gaming, but not with games like NBA 2K","When Mark Deppe, the acting director for University of California, Irvine's esports program, thinks of esports, he doesn't think of traditional sports games like NBA 2K.
It may sound ironic, but compared to high-profile competition games like Overwatch and League of Legends, Take-Two Interactive's basketball-themed series doesn't stack up, Deppe told CNBC.
""I'm a little less bullish on the NBA games just because, one, the viewership's not there right now. It's probably the 50th or 60th most-watched esport,"" Deppe told "" Mad Money "" host Jim Cramer. ""And ... it has to be a balanced game, a fair game going into it, so they actually take out the actual players and their faces and their names, and so you're essentially playing with kind of nameless avatars.""
Deppe, whom Cramer dubbed ""chief gaming officer,"" helped develop UCI's esports program in 2015. The move made UCI the first public university to offer an official program for esports.
UCI was also one of the first schools to begin a scholarship program around esports, offering top gamers $5,610 and $2,500 to join its League of Legends and Overwatch teams, respectively.
For teams, the program provides a personal trainer, team psychologist and a host of team-building activities that help gamers socialize outside of virtual realms, Deppe said.
The ""self-funded"" program draws on support from sponsors like Logitech , which provides high-end gear for the school's esports arena, Deppe told Cramer. The school also charges non-team gamers for their time in the arena.
And Deppe's work is paying off: UCI's Overwatch team is playing UC San Diego for the national title in two weeks with 16 wins and no losses under its belt.
But the esports chief flagged one obstacle for big-name organizations like the NCAA that are interested in entering the space.
""One thing that's really unique about esports is that the games are owned by companies and that's intellectual property that would have to be involved,"" Deppe said. ""The way I see it unfolding now is these game companies are choosing to own and operate their own collegiate leagues and I'm very comfortable with that.""
As top gaming companies like Activision-Blizzard race to develop the next major multi-played competition games, Deppe said he could see even bigger players like Amazon entering the industry.
""I'm very bullish on it,"" Deppe said. ""I think the internet has changed every industry on the planet and esports is the next evolution in competition. You play against who you want regardless of age, gender, where they live, and you play against people your ability level. I think that's really powerful. You don't have referees messing up your game for you. All the rules are built into the game, so I think our expectations are changing with the internet and I think esports are going to meet those expectations.""

Johnson & Johnson Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso plans to retire in September and will be replaced by Joseph Wolk, vice president of investor relations, the company said Tuesday. 
Caruso was named CFO in 2007 and has held the position longer than anyone in company history. He has been with J&J for 19 years. 
""During his nearly 12 years as CFO, Dominic provided Credo-based leadership and financial stewardship through the economic downturn and was instrumental in helping the Company deliver significant gains over the past five years,"" CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement. The ""credo"" is a reference to the company's 75-year-old code. 
Wolk is slated to start July 1. He has reported directly to Caruso since 2004 when he joined the finance leadership team. He previously served as vice president of finance and chief financial officer of J&J's Janssen business.

6396,Trump: 'I wish I did' pick someone other than Jeff Sessions to be attorney general,"President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that he wishes he had picked someone other than Jeff Sessions to be attorney general.

Trump tweet 3
Gowdy made the comments about Sessions on Wednesday's edition of ""CBS This Morning.""
Once friendly with the attorney general, Trump has targeted much of his wrath over the Russia probe at the former Alabama senator after Sessions recused himself last year from the Justice Department 's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys in the Russia probe, told CNBC that Trump still seems frustrated over Sessions for the recusal ""because he believes he should not have in the first place.""
The Justice Department declined to comment.
Sessions' recusal came March 2, 2017, after The Washington Post reported on previously undisclosed contacts between the Alabama Republican and the Russian ambassador during the campaign and the transition period. Sessions, who was a key surrogate and advisor for Trump during the campaign, had not disclosed the meetings during his confirmation hearing before the Senate.
The Wednesday tweets came on the heels of a New York Times article that said the president had asked Sessions to reverse his decision to recuse himself.
Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the reported request as part of an inquiry into whether Trump obstructed justice.
Trump has repeatedly denied that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to undermine Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy. He also has denied that he obstructed justice, and has often called the probe a ""witch hunt.""

4117,Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: There may be more countries exempted from the tariffs,"Canada and Mexico may not be the only two countries getting a break from the U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday the process will continue to determine whether other countries should be excused from the duties that President Donald Trump announced Thursday.
""The president can do exemptions, and my expectation is there may be some other countries that he considers in the next two weeks,"" Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC's "" Squawk Alley .""
Mnuchin said earlier this week he favors the recently adopted tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
However, the tariffs have been controversial, with members of Trump's own Republican party pushing back on his efforts to level the playing field for American manufacturers. Trump justified the tariffs by saying the imports were posing a threat to national security.
Mnuchin said they are all part of the president's agenda, including the historic tax cuts passed in December, seeking to protect U.S. interests at home and abroad.
""This is not a conventional president, and because of that we're getting results that we wouldn't have otherwise seen,"" he said. ""A lot of people said we'd never get tax reform done, a lot of people said the U.S. economy could never grow at 3 percent.""
The Treasury chief spoke at the New York Stock Exchange, amid the backdrop of a rallying stock market following Friday's government report that nonfarm payrolls had jumped 313,000 in February, well above Wall Street expectations.
""Anytime we do anything, we have to analyze the risks,"" he said. ""But if you want to move forward with the agenda for American companies you have to be willing to take certain risks.""
Mnuchin also spoke at length about the news breaking overnight that Trump will meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Un for talks about nuclear weapons.
A year of ""maximum pressure"" on the Kim government is paying dividends, Mnuchin said.
""The president is determined that there won't be nuclear weapons on the peninsula,"" he said. ""I think this is a very important move forward that they're willing to say they will stop the testing and they're willing to have discussions.""",2018-03-09T18:10:00.000+02:00
3385,Sandbags and warnings as northeast US braces for storm-driven flood,"Businesses blocked doors with sandbags and officials warned residents of waterfront homes to be ready to evacuate as the northeastern United States braced for a powerful storm on Friday that threatened to flood coasts from Maine to North Carolina.
Along Boston's Long Wharf, not far from the Fanueil Hall tourist area, large piles of sandbags were in place around a subway station and a Marriott hotel, a spot that flooded with icy seawater during an early January storm.
A combination of heavy rains, monthly extreme high tides and a wind-driven storm surge could combine to cause several feet of water to flow onto streets in coastal parts of Boston and up and down the shoreline, government and private weather forecasters warned. High winds of up to 75 miles per hour (120 kmph) could also bring extensive power outages.
""People need to take this very seriously,"" Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told a Thursday press conference, telling people to prepare for a repeat of the flooding that affected much of state's east coast during the Jan. 4 ""bombogenesis"" winter storm. ""If you live in an area that is told to evacuate, we strongly encourage you do so first thing Friday morning.""
Essdras M Suarez | The Boston Globe | Getty Images The National Weather Service had coastal flood watches and warnings in place from southern Maine through coastal North Carolina, including New York's eastern suburbs, and also warned that a snowstorm heading east from the Ohio Valley could drop significant amounts of snow in northern New York State. It forecast storm surges of up to four feet (1.2 m) for eastern Massachusetts.
Ocean-facing homes could be destroyed by the storm surge and waves, while people who live in neighborhoods reached by low-lying roads could be cut off from services for hours or days, officials and government forecasters warned.
""This could be another storm with prolonged onshore flooding,"" said Paul Walker, a senior meteorologist with private forecasting services Accuweather.
Flooding could begin to pick up around high tide, forecast to occur shortly after 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT) around Boston, he said.
Walker also noted that the combinations of high winds and sustained rain, which softens the ground, could lead extensive downed trees and power outages.

4555,"A solid earnings season won't be enough to avert another correction, economist Robert Shiller says","1:46 PM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 02:48 
Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller believes a strong earnings season may not be adequate to keep stocks out of the red. 
Despite two corrections since February, the Yale University Professor — who predicted both the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the housing meltdown that triggered the 2008 financial crisis — contended market valuations are still overvalued. 
""As of the fourth quarter, real S&P 500 earnings were still below their 2015, if you correct for inflation. So, it's not like we are in this spectacular market,"" Shiller said this week on CNBC's "" Trading Nation ."" 
However, he warned: ""Obviously, a solid earnings season is good news for the market. But it's not something that we should bank on."" 
So far, first quarter earnings season is getting off to a solid start. On Friday, big banks JP Morgan Chase , Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported solid beats against the top and bottom lines . 
Yet, the broader markets didn't take it as signal to run higher. The Dow closed lower by a half percentage point. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq also lost ground. But the three indexes still were up on the week. 
Whether disappointing earnings enter the picture, or investors become nervous due to Mideast or trade war risks, Shiller contends it's often unclear what sparks an extended stock market downturn. 
""What will take us lower? That is always the question people have. What triggers corrections,"" he asked. ""Typically, there really isn't any really big news except news of the correction."" 
For now, he cites President Donald Trump's business-friendly stance, and his flair for connecting with some people, as a positive for stocks. 
""We never had a President this capable of inspiring people,"" noted Shiller. 
Despite Shiller's take on Trump, he sees volatility continuing to tick higher under his leadership. 
""There is still risk in the market,"" Shiller said. ""The United States is the most expensive market in the world."" ",2018-04-15T00:00:00.000+03:00

But he said, ""There's no way to calibrate it. They [the government] have their own problems with seasonal adjustments in the first quarter.""
The Commerce Department last week reported in its initial look at first-quarter U.S. economic activity that growth slowed to a 2.3 percent annual rate. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

""The 'Berkshire Hathaway index' of business activity,"" Buffett said tongue-and-cheek, "" is stronger than it's been. It's been improving year after year after the financial panic.""
Buffett gets a rare birdseye view of the economy because of the wide range of businesses that Berkshire owns. He spoke to CNBC Thursday evening from Omaha, Nebraska, where tens of thousands of Berkshire shareholders will be gathering this weekend for Saturday's annual meeting.
Buffett also revealed to CNBC that in the first quarter, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought an astounding 75 million shares of Apple. That adds to the 165.3 million shares Berkshire already owned at the end of 2017.

5051,Postmates says it has added $1.2 billion to the economy since 2017,"The gig economy is doing more than just providing convenience for consumers. New data from on-demand delivery service Postmates underscores the opportunities presented by this growing sector of the workforce for businesses and workers alike.

Postmates teamed up with Edelman Intelligence to create an economic impact model to measure the effect it's had on cities, businesses and work forces in the 300 U.S. markets it operates in. The data show from 2017 to date, $1.2 billion in has been generated through the Postmates platform, which connects 150,000 couriers to 25,000 merchant partners to deliver goods on-demand. Couriers earned $216.8 million last year, averaging $18.32 an hour.

From 2015 through 2017, Postmates says it has generated $380 million in sales in Los Angeles and $127.7 million in New York during that same time period.
The company also measured business growth both on and off its platform for partner merchants and finds businesses reported growing 3.7 times faster once they teamed up with Postmates, which prides itself on getting customers their orders in an hour or less.

""There is a fundamental shift happening in our cities right now — it's not just that customers and buyers can summon anything at the click of a button to their doorstep,"" says Vikrum Aiyer, head of strategic communications and policy at Postmates. ""But there is also a difference in how businesses are competing as a result of a shift in commerce.""
Candice Choi | AP Postmates is different from some of its larger competitors like Grubhub, which is a public company focused on food delivery, as it also fulfills orders beyond food to include goods, targeting local hardware or electronics stores in addition to food deliveries.

Analysts say seeing this kind of growth in markets like Los Angeles and New York City isn't surprising, but expanding beyond the largest metros in the U.S. may prove more challenging as both consumers and companies have different preferences.

""The data we see in the top 30 MSAs in the U.S., and similarly in Canada, is where these services have grown the fastest,"" says Foster Finley, global co-head of transportation and infrastructure practice at consulting firm AlixPartners. (MSAs, or metropolitan statistical areas, are geographic regions with a high population density.)
""It's triggered a fascinating phenomenon, but when you go to tier-two cities, in many cases, the same growth isn't there. There's a bifurcation between big metropolitan areas, where there is a higher concentration of digitally-minded industries, and the rest of the world,"" Finley added.

Delivery has become a major focus for not just small businesses, but also restaurant chains.
McDonald's and UberEats have a marquee partnership, and Yum Brands , the parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, bought a 3 percent stake in GrubHub earlier this year.

""I think where delivery works is really a byproduct of the market itself, how densely populated it is and spending patterns of consumers,"" says R.J. Hottovy, senior restaurant and retail analyst at Morningstar. ""There are pros and cons as a restaurant operator — you get greater incremental revenue from it, add new customers and get better access to consumer data. But it can be expensive — from 15 to 25 percent of a cut — to participate in these partnerships.""

But to be clear, Hottovy and Finley agree, the ' Amazon Effect' isn't a trend.
""It's a big play in urban markets and I think we'll continue to see consolidation in the space over the years to come of delivery services. There's been a debate over whether this is a fad or not, but I don't think it's going away,"" Hottovy said.",2018-04-13T20:49:00.000+03:00
5311,Mark Zuckerberg was ready to slam Apple if Congress asked him about Tim Cook's privacy comments,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook have exchanged words over privacy during the last few weeks — in a battle that could be set to continue.
It started when Cook was asked what he would do if he were faced with the problems facing Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal . 
""I wouldn't be in this situation,"" Cook said in an interview with Recode's Kara Swisher and MSNBC's Chris Hayes last month. The Apple CEO questioned the practise of monetizing user data on social media platforms.
Zuckerberg then hit back days later , saying that the service should be free.
""You know, I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib. And not at all aligned with the truth,"" Zuckerberg said in an ""Ezra Klein Show"" podcast published Monday by Vox.
There hasn't been much else said since then, but Zuckerberg was ready to take on Apple if lawmakers asked him about it during his testimony on Tuesday in front of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.

2433,Eaton Vance: Retail volatility products 'the tip of the iceberg' in market turmoil,"While a lot of attention has been paid to retail volatility products that contributed to the recent sell-off, those securities are ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, told CNBC on Tuesday.
Last week, bets against market volatility imploded and helped fuel the market correction. The most high-profile crash was that of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term , which trades under the ticker symbol XIV. Credit Suisse, which issues the XIV, then said it would close the fund. 
However, ""the institutional money behind those same, similar strategies is what's really driving the market,"" Perkin said in an interview with "" Power Lunch. ""
He's referring to minimum volatility and risk parity funds that are used by institutional investors, like hedge funds. Essentially those investors try to define every asset class through how volatile it is, and when volatility increases, they reduce their exposure to those asset classes that appear to have too much volatility.
The term volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty in the size (and direction) of changes in a market and is typically measured by the deviation of returns.
Perkin said there are hundreds of billions of dollars behind these types of strategies.
""It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where the more volatility there is, the more you have to sell and that drives further volatility,"" he explained.
Perkin added, ""The computers are running the show and there's not that much money that is price sensitive, fundamentally based where there is an active decision-maker, human being saying, 'I'm stepping in to buy.'""
He doesn't think the products were entirely behind the recent sell-off, however. Rising interest rates were the main factor, fueled by the volatility plays and high valuations, he said.
""When stock prices fall for no good reason that's the buying opportunity"" for long-term investors, he said.

5611,Some airlines are re-routing flights because of potential air strikes in Syria,"Some major airlines were re-routing flights on Wednesday after Europe's air traffic control agency warned aircraft flying in the eastern Mediterranean to exercise caution due to possible air strikes into Syria .
Eurocontrol said in a notification published on Tuesday afternoon that air-to-ground and cruise missiles could be used over the following 72 hours and there was a possibility of intermittent disruption to radio navigation equipment.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Western allies are discussing possible military action to punish Syria's President Bashar Assad for a suspected poison gas attack on Saturday on a rebel-held town that had long held out against government forces.
A spokeswoman for Air France said the airline had changed some flights paths following the warning, including for Beirut and Tel Aviv flights, while budget airline easyJet said it would also re-route flights from Tel Aviv.
Aviation regulators have been stepping up monitoring of conflict zones since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board.
Recent warnings have tended to be after military action has started, and so Eurocontrol's pre-emptive notice suggests a heightening of regulatory scrutiny.
Trump on Tuesday cancelled a planned trip to Latin America later this week to focus on responding to the Syria incident, the White House said.
Trump on Monday warned of a quick, forceful response once responsibility for the attack was established.
The Eurocontrol warning on its website did not specify the origin of any potential missile threat.
""Due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria with air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles within the next 72 hours, and the possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment, due consideration needs to be taken when planning flight operations in the Eastern Mediterranean/Nicosia FIR area,"" it said, referring to the designated airspace.
Aviation regulators in countries including the United States , Britain , France and Germany have previously issued warnings against airlines entering Syrian airspace, leading most carriers to avoid the area.
The only commercial flights above Syria as of Wednesday morning were being flown by Syrian Air and Lebanon's Middle East Airlines, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. At other periods later in the day, there were no flights using the airspace.
Heightened surveillance Eurocontrol included a broader area outside the airspace controlled by Damascus in its statement.
A spokesman for Germany's Lufthansa said on Wednesday its airlines were aware of the Eurocontrol warning and were in close contact with authorities.
""As a proactive precaution, Lufthansa Group airlines have already avoided the airspace in the eastern Mediterranean for some time now,"" he said.
Ryanair, British Airways, Etihad Airways, and Royal Jordanian representatives said flights were operating normally at their respective airlines, but the situation was being monitored closely.
Emirates also said it was closely monitoring the situation and that it would ""make adjustments as needed"".
EgyptAir is not currently planning changes to flight paths following the warning, a source close to the matter said.
Israel 's flag carrier El Al declined to comment. EgyptAir and several other major airlines that fly in the area did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The Nicosia flight information region named in the Eurocontrol statement covers the island of Cyprus and surrounding waters, according to a map on the agency's website.
The same map did not designate any specific territory as being the ""Eastern Mediterranean"" region.
Last year, North Korea tested missiles without warning, leading some airlines to re-route flights to avoid portions of the Sea of Japan.
Eurocontrol's warning cited a document from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Europe's safety regulator.
EASA warned of a danger to aircraft flying over Iran, Iraq, and the Caspian sea in October 2015 after Russia fired cruise missiles at Syrian targets from the Caspian Sea.
An EASA spokesman said it had informed member states and Eurocontrol of its cautionary message on Tuesday.",2018-04-11T18:05:00.000+03:00
2391,"Amazon closes up 1% after stock soars past $1,500 for the first time","Amazon shares hit a new all-time high on Wednesday, surpassing $1,500 for the first time.
The stock closed up about 1 percent at $1,482.92, after hitting $1,503.49 a share, the highest level since the e-commerce company's initial public offering in 1997, according to FactSet.
Amazon has built more support from Wall Street after this week's lackluster earnings from rival Walmart . The stock's tear — it's up about 73 percent over the past year— leaves Amazon deadlocked with Microsoft as the third-largest American public company.
Using its lead in industries like retail and cloud computing, Amazon has invested in new areas, like healthcare. That move also made headlines this week. CNBC reported that Amazon quietly launched an exclusive line of over-the-counter health products . And Albertson's Tuesday agreement to buy Rite Aid could improve the combined companies' chances to compete against Amazon, which also owns grocer Whole Foods. 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has personally reaped the rewards of Amazon's success. Between when the market opened and the day's high, the world's richest person added more than $1.4 billion in value to his Amazon holdings.
But Bezos has long insisted that he's not interested in daily stock moves. Since the IPO in 1997, the company's credo has been to ""make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations short-term Wall Street reactions.""",2018-02-21T23:04:00.000+02:00

The U.S. drugmaker's shares surged 5 percent to $61.65 in premarket trading.
The results present a challenge to Swiss drugmaker Roche and Merck's U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Squibb , both of which are developing key lung cancer combination treatments of their own.
Roche said last month its immunotherapy Tecentriq, when combined with other drugs, doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without their disease advancing.
Roche's shares fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday, while shares of Bristol-Myers dipped nearly 2 percent in U.S. premarket trading.
The Merck study tested a cocktail of Keytruda, Eli Lilly's Alimta and a standard chemotherapy as an initial treatment for patients with a type of non-small-cell lung cancer, a common form of the disease.
The study met its main goals of preventing cancer from worsening and extending patients' overall survival.
Keytruda is already approved to treat several types of cancer including lung cancer, both as a single agent and in combination with other drugs.",2018-01-16T15:46:00.000+02:00

Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio is running for U.S. Senate. 
The 85-year-old immigration hard-liner on Tuesday announced his intention to run for the seat that will soon be vacated by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake , an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump . 
""I have a lot to offer. I'm a big supporter of President Trump,"" Arpaio told the Washington Examiner in a phone interview . In another interview, with liberal-leaning site Talking Points Memo, Arpaio said he didn't discuss his decision to run with either the president or White House officials . 
Arpaio's candidacy sets up a potentially volatile dynamic during this year's midterm election season, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has sought to boost more traditional Republicans over populist and nativist candidates championed by Trump and his former advisor and campaign chief Steve Bannon . 
The Republicans have a razor-thin margin of 51 to 49 in the Senate, after Democrat Doug Jones last month triumphed over Republican Roy Moore in traditionally deep-red Alabama. 
Trump pardoned Arpaio in August after the former Maricopa County sheriff was convicted of contempt of court over his practice of racially profiling Latinos. 
Pro-Trump Republican Kelli Ward is already running for the seat, and mainstream Rep. Martha McSally is expected to enter the race. Arpaio tweet 
Arizona's secretary of State's office said the state doesn't hold runoff elections in case a primary winner ends up with less than 50 percent of the vote. 
""Conceivably we could have a dozen candidates in a special primary election. Who knows, maybe somebody with less than 20 percent of the vote will get elected,"" spokesman Matt Roberts told CNBC. 
The Arizona primary is slated for Aug. 28. 
The Alabama special GOP primary for Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' former Senate seat ended up in a runoff because no candidate reached 50 percent in the first primary vote. Sen. Luther Strange, the establishment candidate backed by McConnell who was endorsed by Trump during the primary, lost to Moore, who was supported by Bannon and eventually earned Trump's full-throated endorsement despite allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. 
Moore, who is known for his anti-gay views and other hard-right positions, then lost in the main special election to former prosecutor Jones, marking the first time a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in more than two decades. 
Likewise, it has been more than two decades since Arizona had a U.S. senator from the Democratic Party. The Democratic field in the race for Flake's seat includes Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. 
Trump beat his Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 4 percentage points in Arizona during the 2016 presidential election.

(Adds Chinese demand for high quality iron ore, background on debt goal) 
SAO PAULO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Continued Chinese efforts to reduce pollution will boost demand for Vale's high quality iron ore, the Brazilian miner's chief executive said on Tuesday, even as the world's top iron ore producer seeks to diversify away from the metal. 
China's aggressive campaign to clean its skies by clamping down on polluting steel mills has fueled a need for high-grade iron ore to boost productivity and limit emissions, opening the door wider for suppliers of better quality ore to the world's biggest buyer. 
""I cannot imagine China going back on the pollution controls it is trying to put in place,"" CEO Fabio Schvartsman said at an event in Sao Paulo. ""They will do everything possible ... to check pollution, which guarantees their demand."" 
Nevertheless, Schvartsman said the company will seek to reduce the percent of earnings derived from iron ore from the current 90 percent to around 70 percent within two years. 
""The company is beginning to become truly diversified,"" Schvartsman said, adding that base metals would be a fundamental part of the diversification strategy. 
Schvartsman also said a recent rise in nickel prices should generate an additional $750 million in cash flow and that the company expected to reach its $10 billion net debt target by the middle of year. 
A Vale executive said earlier this month that company could reach its net debt goal of $10 billion before the year end. (Reporting by Luciano Costa and Tatiana Bautzer; Writing by Alexandra Alper; Editing by Diane Craft and Marguerita Choy)",2018-01-30T21:41:00.000+02:00
2919,UPDATE 3-Brazil farmers may reap benefits from U.S.-China trade tensions -official,"UPDATE 3-Brazil farmers may reap benefits from U.S.-China trade tensions -official Ana Mano Reuters 
-official@ (Adds comments from trade consultant, value of soy exports to China) 
SAO PAULO, March 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's position as an agriculture powerhouse may be bolstered by rising trade tensions between the United States and China after U.S. President Donald Trump announced his plan for steel and aluminum tariffs, an official said on Friday. 
Brazil is the world's largest exporter of agricultural goods including soybeans, beef and sugar. China is the globe's largest soy importer and last year bought 95.5 million tonnes of the oilseeds, more than half from the South American nation. 
""Signs of growing tensions between the United States and China may be a good opportunity for Brazil, given our prowess to produce grains like soy and corn,"" said Carlos Favaro, vice governor of Mato Grosso state, Brazil's largest grain-growing region. 
Brazil sold $20.3 billion in soy to China last year. It has increased that trade over the years, from 22.9 million tonnes five years ago to 53.8 million tonnes in 2017. 
Favaro, himself a soy producer, added that Brazil could expand commercial ties with China, noting such bonds have been steadily growing in recent years as China has invested heavily in Brazil's agribusiness sector and infrastructure projects. 
""China needs our raw materials and we need strong commercial ties with them, while maintaining our sovereignty,"" Favaro said. 
Brazil's industry ministry said on Thursday after Trump announced his tariff plan that the country would consider taking action on its own over the tariffs or in concert with other nations. 
Roberto Rodrigues, Brazil's agriculture minister between 2003 and 2006, said Trump's announcement was not good news, regardless of its impact on grain exports. 
""Agriculture may benefit, but for the steel industry this is negative,"" he said. ""One sector wins, but not Brazilian society."" 
Rodrigues said he feared that if the United States goes ahead with its tariffs, it could ""create a wave of protectionism."" 
Brazil exported 110.8 million tonnes of grains in 2017, including soybeans, soymeal, soy oil and corn, according to data from shipping company Williams. The Brazil unit of China's food company Cofco Corp was among the country's five top exporters with 9.3 million tonnes, the data showed. 
Favaro's remarks demonstrate that Brazil could benefit from growing U.S. protectionism, though he said ""it is early to define"" how the situation will play out. 
Jason Hafemeister, trade counsel to the U.S. agriculture secretary, told Reuters last week that the United States has been concerned that China might impose trade barriers on U.S. grains sales if trade relations between the world's two largest economies worsen. 
Already, a tougher U.S. trade stance in relation to Mexico has benefited Brazilian farmers, who exported 10 times more corn to Mexico last year amid concern that NAFTA talks could disrupt their U.S. supplies, according to government data and top grains merchants. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said he does not see a threat from Brazil to U.S. corn sales to Mexico because American farmers enjoy advantages in areas like logistics that Brazilian farmers do not. 
Rodrigo Lima, general director of Agroicone, a Sao Paulo-based international trade think tank, believes U.S. trade tensions could boost the potential of some bilateral talks Brazil is conducting, especially with Mexico. 
""Mexico was always a hard market to enter, due to non-tariff barriers, sanitary barriers. But talks are progressing now. We are discussing preferences,"" he said. ""We are selling corn to Mexico now. Can we sell poultry? Can we sell beef?"" 
Even if certain products benefit, Brazil in general would suffer in the event of a broader trade war because it relies on stable, predictable global trade rules as a country with limited clout compared with big players, said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo. 
""Above all it increases risk,"" Stuenkel said.

NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told an agriculture conference on Wednesday that he and President Donald Trump support the nation's biofuels policy, and that any reports to the contrary are ""fake news."" 
Perdue made the comments a day after Trump hosted a meeting with Cabinet officials and senators to discuss potential changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard to help refiners who say they are struggling under the program. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation's fuel. 
That meeting yielded no deal. 
""I can tell you Trump stands with corn farmers, biofuel farmers and the RFS,"" Perdue told an audience at the Commodity Classic in Anaheim, California, according to a recording heard by Reuters. ""I stand with him and with you."" 
He said reports that the administration does not support the RFS are ""fake news."" ""I have not, will not, diminish demand for ethanol or hurt the RFS,"" Perdue said. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that Perdue made the comments. 
Trump's meeting on Tuesday reflected rising concern in the White House over the current state of the RFS, which has increasingly divided two of Trump's most important constituencies: the energy industry and rural farmers. 
A refining company in Pennsylvania, which often plays a key role deciding the outcome in national elections, last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, bolstering charges by the industry that it is unfair and costly. 
The White House meeting was held at the request of Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and was intended to get Chuck Grassley and Jodi Ernst, both Republican senators from the corn state Iowa, to accept significant changes to the program aimed at providing financial relief to refiners.

6231,I'm tired of ordering Alexa and Siri around — we need male virtual assistants,"Women represent just 5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs and less than 10 percent of the top tech VCs.
But don't worry ladies, we've got the virtual assistant gig locked up.
Siri, Alexa, Cortana and their growing list of peers are designed to serve. They're designed to take orders and never ask for a ""thank you."" And so far, almost without exception, they're designed to be female.
I didn't notice the trend for a while. I don't have an Amazon Alexa-enabled speaker, and I've never interacted with Microsoft 's Cortana, so I wasn't constantly exposed.
But that's a rarity now. As the voice wars heat up and the giants of Silicon Valley race to get their assistants into every home and pocket, the ever-present female subordinate is sending a bad message.
My nephew is 4 years old and knows how to engage Alexa. My stepbrother is 14 and asks Siri questions through his Apple iPhone. The idea that virtual assistants would ingrain any of sort gender inequality in either of them is genuinely gut-wrenching.
It's the same kind of icky, not-quite-right feeling I experienced while watching ""Mad Men"" with the corporate office full of male superiors and their female support staff. We're all Roger Sterling in this analogy, and that should make you uncomfortable.
There are countless studies that claim, among other things:
All genders consider the female voice warmer Women are often considered more helpful — virtual assistants are designed to help, after all Voices at a higher pitch are just plain easier to understand. Some of that may be true. Some of it likely is not. But either way, the assumption that virtual assistants should be female is a problem.
I changed my Siri assistant to a male voice a couple years ago. Siri's default voice in American English is female but switching the language to British English, French, Arabic or a handful of other languages will also switch the gender.
Google 's name-less assistant defaults to a female voice on phones, and randomly selects one of two voice options when users first boot up a Google Home. One of the voices would be considered traditionally female and one traditionally male, though Google says it doesn't think of their voices as gendered.
The company also announced earlier this month it would be adding new voice options , including male voices and the voice of singer John Legend.
Cortana and Alexa, though, are pretty nailed down.
Amazon says it workshopped several voices, including male options, and found users preferred Alexa's current voice.

""We did extensive research and found there is a certain warmth to a femaile voice that is associated with helpfulness,"" the spokesperson said.
I don't need the tech giants to make all virtual assistants men. Just don't make the decision for me that they should be women. Present the option next time I activate a new iPhone. Avoid obviously gendered names.

The lawsuit claimed Target's use of criminal background checks disqualified job applicants for convictions that were unrelated to the work they sought. Target was accused of having ""imported the racial and ethnic disparities"" in the U.S. criminal justice system into its hiring process.

Target has agreed to pay $3.74 million and upgrade its hiring process to settle a lawsuit claiming its use of criminal background checks kept thousands of black and Hispanic job applicants from employment. 
The preliminary settlement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requires a judge's approval. 
It resolves claims that the Minneapolis-based retailer, which has performed background checks for employment in U.S. stores since 2001, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on race, gender and other characteristics. 
Target was accused of having ""imported the racial and ethnic disparities"" in the U.S. criminal justice system into its hiring process, in part by disqualifying job applicants for convictions that were unrelated to the work they sought. 
The settlement calls for eligible blacks and Hispanics who were since May 2006 wrongly denied hourly and entry-level jobs such as cashiers, cart attendants, food service workers and stockers to receive $1.2 million or ""priority hiring."" 
Another $600,000 will go to nonprofits that help people with criminal histories reenter the workforce, while most of the rest will cover legal and other fees, the settlement said. Target did not admit wrongdoing. 
Jenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer no longer asks for criminal histories in job applications, but still considers convictions ""important"" and gathers criminal background information late in the hiring process. 
""We have a number of measures in place to ensure we're fair and equitable in our hiring,"" while ""maintaining a safe and secure working and shopping environment for team members and guests,"" she said. 
The plaintiffs included Carnella Times and Erving Smith, who are black and claimed they were denied stocker jobs after background checks uncovered past convictions, and The Fortune Society, which helps former prisoners reenter society.

""I remember when you could still get a $5 bill out of an ATM and I couldn't get it because [my balance] was under $5,"" McCarthy tells the publication.
McCarthy, 47, who was raised on a farm in Illinois, started out going to fashion school in New York City. And she wasn't very smart about money.
""When I moved to New York at 20, I wish I did not discover that you can just get credit cards. I had a friend — Brian Atwood, the shoe designer — and I remember him saying, 'What are you going to do, walk around New York in cheap shoes? You go to Bergdorf,'"" McCarthy tells Glamour. ""I was such a farm girl that I was like, 'I guess he's right.'""
She tried to justify pulling out plastic for such pricey purchases, and tells Glamour, ""I couldn't afford anything in there, but they would just give you a store card, and so we were buying wonderful things. I was like, 'I work really hard. I'll pay this off in increments.' No, [laughs] you will not.""
McCarthy soon quit school to pursue a career in stand-up comedy, but success wasn't immediate, and she spent years hustling in Hollywood before making it.
""I would never quite have the money for rent,"" she says, ""so I would call my mom and dad or my sister and say, 'This is how much I'm short.' They never made me feel guilty, because they knew I wasn't lying around doing nothing,"" she recalls.
Despite having a support system, McCarthy wanted to be financially independent and still remembers what it was like to pull her first paycheck.
""I thought, I don't want to continue this pattern. I want to be able to pay the phone bill and not panic,"" she tells Glamour. So she got a job as a production coordinator and ""got an actual check. It was the first time I stopped calling my parents, and it was an amazing feeling.""
Gregg DeGuire | Getty Images After several years, McCarthy landed her breakout role as Sookie on the CW's ""Gilmore Girls"" in 2000. She went on to star in CBS's ""Mike & Molly"" from 2010 to 2016 and became a box office darling with ""Bridesmaids.""
Today, McCarthy has come a long way from her single-digit bank account . She was ranked by Forbes as the fourth-highest paid actress of 2017 with $18 million in earnings, and Forbes estimates she earned an eight-figure upfront fee for her role in the 2016 remake of ""Ghostbusters.""
Still, McCarthy says she wouldn't change the years of hustling, telling Glamour , ""when you spend 20 years working your butt off, you know yourself better.
""I think the best thing I could have done was struggle until I was 30,"" McCarthy says. ""I always assume every job is my last. Twenty years of desperately trying to get a single job gets deep in your DNA.""

Last month, President Donald Trump slapped a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports to the U.S. The U.S. exempted several major trading partners from steel and aluminum tariffs, including the European Union, Mexico and Canada, but not China. 
Shares of aluminum producer Alcoa jumped almost four percent in after-hours trade after the company reported first quarter earnings that beat expectations. 
Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected: EPS: 0.77 vs. 0.70 cents. Revenue: $3.09 billion vs. $3.08 billion. 
In its earnings release, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company is projecting global demand for aluminum to grow along with an increased global deficit of the metal this year, due to delays in projects to expand smelters, factories where metal is extracted, in China. 
Last month, President Donald Trump slapped a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports to the U.S. The U.S. exempted several major trading partners, including the European Union, Mexico and Canada, but not China. 
Alcoa expects the global aluminum deficit to grow to between 600 thousand metric tons and 1 million metric tons, up from last quarter's deficit estimate of between 300 thousand metric tons and 700 thousand metric tons. 
Global demand for aluminum is projected to grow between 4.25 to 5.25 percent.

466,Why watch other people play video games? What you need to know about esports,"Fans flood arenas wearing their team jerseys. They rush to events in search of players' autographs. But these ""athletes"" they're flocking to see, who spend hours in scrimmages honing their skills, are not football or basketball players — they're gamers.
Competitive video game playing, more commonly known as esports, drew 258 million unique viewers globally last year, according to research firm SuperData. For perspective, the National Football League said 204 million unique viewers tuned into the 2016 NFL regular season in the U.S., based on Nielsen data.
The esports business surged in recent years with the arrival of streaming services like Twitch capable of broadcasting players' video game exploits to thousands of viewers.
Just like ""real"" sports, esports makes money off of investments, branding, advertising and media deals, raking in $1.5 billion in revenue last year, said SuperData. The firm expects the esports industry to hit 299 million viewers this year and top $2 billion in revenue by 2021.

""It's growing at a pretty steady pace, well in to the double digits year over year, which is very healthy,"" said SuperData CEO Joost van Druenen.
Several esports leagues have surfaced, luring investors from traditional sports leagues including former NBA star Rick Fox, owner of esports organization Echo Fox, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Even the International Olympic Committee is reportedly considering adding esports to future Olympic Games .
The latest to launch: the Overwatch League, which kicked off its inaugural season Jan. 10 with 12 teams from cities in the U.S., China and South Korea that will compete against each other in the competitive video game Overwatch . The league will feature regular season matches from a custom-built arena in Los Angeles, leading up to playoffs and a championship event.
""Esports for me is just as, if not more, entertaining as regular sports,"" said Jake Duchesne, a 22-year-old fan who says his love of esports was sparked in the same way he started following the NFL, NBA and NHL — he wanted to watch ""the best of the best"" compete in the sports he enjoyed.
""I have a favorite team, players that I enjoy watching succeed and players that I dislike,"" said Duchesne, who is a student at Arizona State University.
Duchesne also regularly attends events, including the Call of Duty Championship and the League of Legends League Championship series.
How did esports become such a thing? Here's a primer on this growing slice of the video game industry:
What are esports? Esports basically turns video game playing into a sport. In some scenarios, it's on an individual level, but mostly it's through teams.
The games themselves are like different sports types, in some ways. For example, in esports, Call of Duty and League of Legends are equivalent to, say, football and baseball. Esports is the broader concept, while the games are the individual types of sports.
What makes a game an esport? Video games with a strong competitive element fit best as an esport. For example, the Overwatch League is based on the online first-person shooter Overwatch , which features a series of competitive match types.
Fans of the games and teams will watch hours of competition, either through streaming services like Twitch or attending live events.
What is at stake? For esports athletes, as for any competitor, it's about being the best of the best. Of course, the financial incentives are getting bigger, too. The International, a tournament featuring the game Dota 2 , boasts one of the biggest prize pools at $24 million, with the winning team splitting more than $10 million. Last year's League of Legends World Championship had a nearly $5 million pool. This doesn't factor in endorsements or potential sponsorships, which are expected to grow over the next several years.
Because of the money involved, more game publishers have entered the market, such as Activision , Electronic Arts with its sports titles Madden NFL and FIFA, and Turner Broadcasting, which launched ELeague nearly two years ago along with WME | IMG.
What are some of the biggest games? League of Legends (LoL). Publisher Riot Games is the most popular title in esports, a multiplayer online battle arena game where players work together to take down their opponents' nexus housed in the center of their base. There are multiple paths to both bases, which means teams will try to strategize the best approach to their opponents' base, as well as techniques to protect their own. According to research firm SuperData, it boasts more than 100 million monthly active users. Riot runs events year round, and announced last summer it would adopt a franchise model similar to Overwatch League for its North American championship series.
Dota 2. It's similar in style of play to LoL, but run by publisher Valve Software, the same company behind the Steam games marketplace for PC players. Although its player base is smaller (more than 12 million, according to SuperData), it hands out more lucrative cash rewards. It runs The International, with a prize pool of more than $24 million during last year's tournament. There are also several third-party tournaments hosted worldwide.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. In terms of longevity, the Counter-Strike series is among the top games in esports. Some of the game's match types are objective-based, where one team must complete a task and their opponent must stop them. Several third-party organizations run their own tournaments, including Major League Gaming, ELeague and ESL.
Overwatch. Through the Overwatch League, game developer Blizzard and publisher Activision will attempt to run it like a traditional sports league, with city-based teams and ownership, regular seasons and playoff periods. It's a first-person shooter, but with a strong focus on team play, featuring tasks such as escorting a payload to a destination or protecting/attacking key points on a map.
What challenges does esports face? Arguably the biggest is respectability. Some people don't see athletes. They see people playing a video game. For example, on January 9, former sportscaster Keith Olbermann criticized the sports website The Players' Tribune for ""publishing pieces by snotty rando kids playing children's games,"" after the site ran a feature on esports star Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng. Olbermann took some heat on Twitter for that one.
Keith Olbermann tweet
Meanwhile, debate still lingers over whether professional gamers should be considered athletes.
Duchesne said pro gamers have an advantage over traditional athletes because they seem to interact more regularly with fans through streaming or social media.
""There's a level of closeness with esports players that I don't believe is as possible with professional traditional athletes,"" he said.
Another challenge: creating a broadcast experience so viewers can easily follow along, similar to when poker added glass to the tables so viewers could see what cards players held. ""That's makes it interesting and exciting because we have kind of an inside view and we know what's going on,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter in an interview in 2016 .

6265,"A year after Trump exited the Paris Climate Accord, here's how states are going even further","A year after Trump exited the Paris Climate Accord, here's how states are going even further The Trump Administration exited the Paris Climate Agreement exactly one year ago. This short-sighted decision was opposed by more than 550 state legislators from 45 states with a total population of over 298 million constituents. Here's how states are taking action in lieu of the federal government. State Senators Kevin De Leon and Kevin Ranker Published 4 Hours Ago CNBC.com Cheriss May | NurPhoto | Getty Images President Donald Trump made the statement that the United States is withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, in the Rose Garden of the White House, June 1, 2017.
June 1 marks the one year anniversary of the Trump Administration's retreat from the Paris Agreement, a framework backed by every country in the world to reduce climate pollution.
This short-sighted decision was opposed by more than 550 state legislators from 45 states with a total population of over 298 million constituents.
Although the President has declared climate change a hoax and isolated America as the only federal government in the world not to embrace the Paris Agreement, states throughout the country continue to lead the way on climate.
As state legislators, we understand that with the current federal administration's lack of care for the environment and our future, it is up to the states to champion the strong, coordinated climate action that is needed.
Over the past year, states have stepped up and are working to ensure the United States meets the terms of the Paris Agreement. We see this in actions such as the Massachusetts ' State House's bill mandating the state abide by the Paris Agreement's greenhouse gas emissions standards. ""We cannot afford to delay so states are pressing forward with innovative policies to drive climate action. Our colleagues across the country have stepped up to fill the climate action void left by the federal government.""
President Trump's climate retreat has served as a call to action for state legislators to go even further on climate solutions.
Climate change is real and it is caused by human activity. People around the world, here in our country, in our states, and in our own communities, understand this and are already experiencing the impacts and will continue to see increased impacts in the coming decades.
We cannot afford to delay so states are pressing forward with innovative policies to drive climate action.
In Washington State, we introduced a bill to put a price on carbon pollution and joined our colleagues from eight other states in announcing the Carbon Costs Coalition to help drive this climate solution across the country.
Our carbon pricing bill progressed all the way to the Senate Floor--the farthest of any state--showing the progress we've made in building legislative support. Washingtonians demand action, and voters will directly decide on a carbon pricing initiative in the November elections this year.
At least eight states have introduced legislation to reach 100 percent renewable energy in the coming decades. Washington was one of these states to introduce a 100 percent renewable energy bill, mandating an ambitious goal that all of the state's electricity be generated carbon free by 2045.
This supports local jobs in growing renewable industries and protect communities and our natural resources by establishing a clean, efficient, carbon-free energy standard.
In California, we have enacted laws to require 50 percent of our electricity come from renewable energy resources and that doubles the amount of energy efficiency economy wide in the state by the year 2030.
We also have extended our cap and trade program through 2030, and have proposed legislation to ensure that 100 percent of our grid energy comes from zero carbon and renewable resources.
Because California's geography and population includes many disadvantaged communities, we have optimized all of our programs to help lower income and diverse communities first and foremost, spending billions in cap and trade funds.
States are also working to promote the use of electric vehicles. By electrifying our cars, we can reduce transportation emissions, the largest source of emissions in the U.S., and ensure cleaner healthier air for Americans.
States like Hawaii are ensuring more parking spots are reserved for EVs and that rental car companies transition quicker to EVs. Other states such as New York and Maryland implemented incentives for people to transition their cars to EVS such as the ability to receive discounts on tolls or use the carpool lanes.
States have taken action not only to address climate change but to prepare for a future of an altered environment. Maryland now requires that sea level rise be taken into account when building highway projects and Maine has created a Coastal Hazards Commission that will identify and prepare for future coastal hazards such as sea level rise and coastal flooding.
Our colleagues across the country have stepped up to fill the climate action void left by the federal government. We are committed to taking deliberate and coordinated efforts to move forward on climate action to ensure the U.S. does not fall behind the rest of the world.
The 2019 session will witness more states pursuing legislation to price carbon, advance 100 percent renewable energy and clean transportation, and protect our communities from the impacts of climate change.
President Trump might have elected to drop out of the Paris Agreement, but a year later, state legislators across the country stand united for climate action.

5734,"OPEC sees higher 2018 oil supply from rivals, stronger oil demand","OPEC on Thursday revised its forecast for supply growth from its rivals for 2018 by nearly three times more than its revised projection of growth in global oil demand.
It said growth in non-OPEC oil supply was forecast to rise by a further 80,000 barrels per day this year to 1.71 million bpd, driven largely by higher-than-anticipated growth in the first quarter in the United States and the former Soviet Union.
At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its forecast for global oil demand growth for this year by 30,000 bpd to 1.63 million bpd.
""This mainly reflects the positive momentum in the OECD in the 1Q18 on the back of better-than-expected data, and supported by development in industrial activities, colder-than-anticipated weather and strong mining activities in the OECD Americas and the OECD Asia Pacific,"" it said in its monthly market report.
The 14-member, Vienna-based producer group said its collective output according to secondary sources fell by 201,000 bpd to 31.96 million bpd in March from February, driven by declines in Angola, Algeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Libya.
Production in the United Arab Emirates posted the largest month-on-month increase, according to the secondary sources, rising by around 45,000 bpd in March to 2.86 million bpd.
OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia told the group it pumped 9.907 million bpd in March, 28,000 bpd below its February level.
Venezuela reported production of 1.509 million bpd in March, 77,000 bpd below the level it reported in February.
OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014.
The pact runs until the end of the year and OPEC meets in Vienna in June to decide on its next course of action.
Oil stocks in the developed world reversed a rise in January to fall by 17.4 million barrels in February to 2.854 billion barrels, around 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average, OPEC said.
Stock levels are 207 million barrels below their level in February 2017.
""Crude stocks indicated a surplus of 55 million barrels, while product stocks witnessed a deficit of 12 million barrels less than the seasonal norm,"" the report said.",2018-04-12T14:46:00.000+03:00
3092,Cramer's game plan: Stop the hysteria and use weakness to buy,"This week reminded CNBC's Jim Cramer that the stock market often acts more reasonably than investors might expect.
""If you sold stocks when everyone was panicking on Monday, you made a big mistake. The fears turned out to be overblown,"" the "" Mad Money "" host said on Friday. ""I'm proud of the fact that I predicted this and I told you ... please don't freak out ahead of time.""
President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports kept a lid on stocks for most of the week as market-watchers parsed what they would mean for U.S. allies and the economy.
But as the policy loosened, with Trump announcing potential exceptions for Canada, Mexico, and other countries, stocks started to climb again.
Things only got better when Friday's employment report from the Labor Department showed strong job growth without inflation, giving the major averages another boost.
""So many commentators have a tendency to get hysterical whenever something scares them, even a little,"" Cramer said. ""Despite the endlessly negative news coverage, the reality is that good things can happen, too, and when they do, we get terrific days like today.""
With that, Cramer turned to his weekly game plan:
Monday: Equifax analyst meeting Speaking of resilience, the first event Cramer wanted investors to watch was an analyst meeting at Equifax , the credit reporting agency that underwent a massive data breach in 2017.
After the cyberattack, which jeopardized millions of people's confidential data, it seemed like investors had permanently discredited Equifax, sending the $142 stock down to $91 a share.
""But it turns out people have short memories,"" Cramer said. ""The stock was at $142 before the data breach ... and I wouldn't be surprised if it can get back all the way to where it was — from $125, where it is right now — if the company talks about a steady business.""
Tuesday: Dick's Sporting Goods, HD Supply Dick's Sporting Goods : An earnings report from the sports retailer could give investors insight into more than just the company's sales, Cramer said.
The ""Mad Money"" host hoped Dick's would share how products from major suppliers like Nike , Under Armour and the struggling Newell are selling, as well as how its recent ban on assault rifles is affecting business.
HD Supply : Industrial distributor HD Supply's earnings report will also offer a glimpse into tens of thousands of businesses, Cramer said.
""We know housing is slowing. We talked yesterday about autos peaking . But how about the day-to-day businesses that make up the backbone of our economy?"" he said. ""I have found HD to give you a fantastic read.""
Wednesday: Signet Jewelers, Williams-Sonoma Signet : The troubled parent company of Zales, Kay and Jared, embroiled in investigations tied to in-store credit practices and alleged employee harassment , reports earnings on Wednesday.
""They've brought in a new management team to clean up the place. So far we haven't seen even the barest glimmer of a financial turn,"" Cramer said. ""Accessories are selling well in America, though.""
Williams-Sonoma : Cramer will also have his eye on the earnings report from this home furnishings retailer, once one of the fastest growing retail plays around.
""I wonder if Williams-Sonoma will break out when it reports Wednesday night,"" he said. ""Wouldn't shock me. Housewares have been selling incredibly strong at all the companies that I follow.""
Thursday: Dollar General, Adobe, Ulta Beauty, Broadcom Dollar General : Cramer hoped Dollar General would be able to differentiate itself from rival Dollar Tree with its Thursday earnings report.
""I actually have more conviction in Dollar General ... and the stock has come down a lot,"" he said. ""If its stock comes down before Thursday, we've got to take another look.""
Adobe : Calling it ""one of the most enticing companies on earth,"" Cramer expected Adobe to deliver a strong quarter on Thursday thanks to its central role in e-commerce.
Ulta : After a number of very good quarters, Ulta's last few earnings reports seemingly haven't been enough to appease investors, Cramer said.
""Many worry that the Amazon 'Death Star' is now hurting Ulta. Even if Amazon doesn't do any damage, though, some people will assume it's inevitable,"" he said. ""It's an excuse to dump the stock, and maybe next quarter they will. So be careful.""
Broadcom : Cramer expected even better results than the ones Broadcom pre-announced for this quarter. But the company has been relentlessly pursuing a takeover of Qualcomm , which he thought could put a lid on Broadcom's stock.
""I'd like to think Broadcom's shareholders win either way,"" Cramer said. ""Still, the rest of the semis are furiously rallying and I'm sure getting tired of this Broadcom-Qualcomm clash of titans when I see all of the other semis do so well. I just wish they'd get this thing over with, frankly.""
Friday: Tiffany & Co, United Technologies analyst meeting Tiffany : Jewelry play Tiffany reports earnings on Friday. Thanks to benefits from a weak U.S. dollar and strong sales at its Manhattan flagship store, Cramer expected a good quarter.
""Tiffany seems tempting, especially because it's still down a tad for the year,"" he said.
United Technologies : Cramer predicted an analyst meeting at United Technologies would show strength across all of the massive industrial's business lines and shed light on whether a break-up could be in the works.
""Activists are circling, begging for a break-up,"" he said. ""I think CEO Greg Hayes will be forthright about whether he, too, believes a break-up would be a good way to unlock shareholder value.""
Final thoughts ""Here's the bottom line: let's finally stop indulging the chicken little people,"" Cramer concluded. ""Just follow the fundamentals and use any weakness in these high-quality stocks as buying opportunities because you believe in their long-term prospects. Please don't let all the big-picture doomsayers freak you out. Remember this: it's been a mistake to panic nearly every time.""

SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil's government says the country's economy grew in 2017 for the first time in three years, aided by a strong performance in the agricultural sector. 
The government's IBGE statistics bureau said Thursday that the country's gross domestic product increased 1 percent last year after two consecutive contractions of 3.5 percent in 2015 and 2016.

The company posted its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Its new DAU figures are up from 184 million in the fourth quarter, marking less than a 1 percent change but, more importantly, a return to third-quarter levels. Overall Facebook averaged 1.45 billion daily active users in March 2018, an increase of 13 percent year over year.
It also reported first-quarter earnings per share of $1.69, above analyst estimates. Revenue for the quarter was $11.97 billion. Shares were up slightly after the news.
Facebook experienced its first decline in North American DAUs in the fourth quarter of 2017. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said at the time algorithm tweaks over the previous year had led to people spending 5 percent less time on its service , or about 50 million hours per day. Changes included showing fewer viral videos and focusing on showing more ""meaningful social interactions,"" which the company argued would increase valuable engagement time.
Amid the News Feed updates, Facebook also found itself tied up in data privacy issues after it was reported that political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica may have used improperly obtained user information to target voters during the 2016 U.S. election. The news led to a #deleteFacebook movement, which urged users to get rid of their accounts. Zuckerberg said in testimony to Congress that there has not been a ""dramatic falloff"" in Facebook users since the news broke.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to brief reporters on Wednesday as the Trump administration goes before the Supreme Court to defend its travel ban.
President Donald Trump 's travel ban, which he first tried to implement in January 2017, seeks to block entry for people from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen . It also bans travel from Venezuela and North Korea , though those restrictions are not being fought in court.
The administration is defending the legality of the ban , which Trump said will prevent ISIS militants from entering the country – Hawaii argues that the ban violates immigration law and the constitution's rule against favoring certain religions over others, according to Reuters.

860,UPDATE 4-Lula's Brazil presidential run in doubt after conviction upheld,"UPDATE 4-Lula's Brazil presidential run in doubt after conviction upheld Lisandra Paraguassu SHARES 
(Updates with full court vote, protests, fresh market figures, investor quote) 
PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court unanimously upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday and added to his sentence, a major blow to the popular politician's plans to run again for the presidency this year. 
All three appellate court judges voted to uphold Lula's convictions on taking bribes and money laundering. They also added 2 1/2 years to his sentence, condemning him to 12 years in prison. Lula, Brazil's first working-class leader, so far remains free pending future appeals. 
Lula, 72, could now be ineligible to stand for election under Brazil's ""Ficha Limpa"" or ""Clean Record"" law, which bans political candidates whose convictions have been upheld by an appellate court. However, an electoral court must make the final ruling on a candidacy, and would only do so once a candidate had registered. 
Lula can appeal Wednesday's decision by the appeals court in Porto Alegre to higher courts to delay a final ruling, possibly avoiding jail and stringing the process out long enough to register his candidacy by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
Lula's Workers Party called the ruling a ""farce"" orchestrated by Lula's enemies to stop him returning to power. The party said it would resist the decision and push ahead with its plan to launch him as presidential candidate. 
A handful of supporters protested the court decision on Wednesday evening, setting fire to tires in downtown Porto Alegre and across a major highway in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. 
Opponents of Lula, meanwhile, celebrated on Sao Paulo's main avenue with a giant blown-up figure of the ex-president dressed as a prison convict. 
Lula is one of scores of powerful politicians and businessmen caught up in sweeping corruption probes that have wracked the Brazilian establishment since 2014. 
His exclusion from the October election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which Lula is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment. 
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index hit a new intraday high of 83,635 points on news of the unanimous ruling against Lula. It closed 3.32 percent higher on investor expectations his exclusion from the 2018 race will clear the way for a more market-friendly candidate who can stick to Brazil's austerity agenda. 
Brazil's currency, the real, firmed 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, leading gains in Latin America. 
""The ruling takes off the table the worst possible scenario for the market, the biggest downside possible in terms of the election,"" said Roberto Campos, a partner at Sao Paulo-based Absolute Investimentos. ""The guy who was completely not market-friendly is out."" 
MORE CASES 
Lula faces six more indictments in corruption cases ranging from receiving bribes from engineering firm Odebrecht to obstructing justice and trafficking his influence to obtain government decisions favoring the auto industry. 
He is among over 100 people convicted in the ""Car Wash"" investigation, the most sprawling of Brazil's numerous probes. It focuses on graft involving oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, and other state-run companies. 
Speaking at a union rally on the outskirts of Sao Paulo on Wednesday, Lula told the crowd: ""I committed no crime."" 
""The only fair decision today would be a 3-0 ruling that I was wrongly convicted and sentenced,"" he said. 
Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with Petrobras. 
Prosecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million). Lula maintains he never owned the penthouse apartment, criticizing prosecutors for what Lula's lawyers called a reliance on the plea bargain testimony of one witness, businessman Leo Pinheiro. 
""His word is not enough to incriminate Lula,"" Lula's lawyer Cristiano Zanin told the appeals court.
