0,ACCT 210:,Financial Accounting,"Financial accounting is the measurement of economic activity for decision-making. Financial statements are a key product of this measurement process and an important component of firms' financial reporting activities. The objective of this course is not to train you to become an accountant but rather to help you develop into an informed user of financial statement information. While financial statement users face a wide variety of decisions, they are often interested in understanding the implications of financial statement information for the future cash flows and earnings potential of a firm. We will focus on understanding the mapping between underlying economic events and financial statements, and on understanding how this mapping affects inferences about future profitability and liquidity. The following learning objectives will be emphasized: (1) familiarity with the transactions businesses engage in, (2) fluency in accounting terminology, (3) understanding the structure that maps transactions into accounting numbers, (4) understanding the rationale for various accounting methods, and (5) awareness of the judgment involved and the discretion allowed in choosing accounting methods, making estimates, and disclosing information in financial statements.",Aut,3,"; Kim, J. (PI); deHaan, E. (PI); Oseguera, J. (GP); Rice, R. (GP)"

(PI); Rivera, S. (GP)"
6,ACCT 313:,Financial Statement Analysis,"This course is designed to develop students' ability to interpret and use financial accounting information across various economic decision contexts. The perspective taken is that of an outsider relying on publicly-available financial information for investment, credit, and strategic decision-making purposes. The course relies heavily upon financial statement analysis tools and the economic profit-based valuation framework. Through lectures, in-depth case studies, and real-time exercises, the first half of the course covers traditional financial statement analysis-based tools for critically analyzing and assessing a firm's current financial performance and economic condition, including ratio analysis, accounting quality analysis, and financial distress / bankruptcy prediction models. The second half of the course introduces an accounting-based valuation framework and develops the link between financial statement analysis, firm performance, and firm value. The capstone to the course is the completion of a comprehensive, real-time analysis and valuation of a publicly traded firm (or registered IPO candidate). The course is structured for students to gain a deeper understanding of the economic pressures behind the valuation creation and valuation process. The course will be useful to those students who anticipate making investment or credit decisions at least partially based on historical and prospective financial statement information, and those who want to have a better understanding of how to use financial information to assess whether and how any organization is creating value through its operations and strategic actions.",Spr,3,"; Piotroski, J. (PI); Woodhall, E. (GP)"
7,ACCT 317:,"Managerial Accounting: Performance Measurement, Compensation, and Governance","The course will examine the academic and professional controversies surrounding corporate governance and executive compensation. A basic framework will be developed to integrate the many important dimensions of corporate governance in the U.S. and international settings. The institutional features of corporate governance and executive compensation will be documented using the professional business and legal literatures. In addition, the scientific research in accounting, economics, finance, and organizational behavior will be used to provide insights into the measurement and consequences of observed corporate governance and executive compensation choices. After successfully finishing the course, a student should be able to (i) understand the debates about appropriate choices for corporate governance and executive compensation and (ii) critically evaluate the implications of academic and professional research studies on these controversial issues.",Spr,3,"; Epstein, E. (PI); Shaker, S. (GP)"
8,ACCT 332:,Mergers and Acquisitions,"This course provides a comprehensive overview of strategic, economic and financial issues related to mergers and acquisitions.  Specifically, we review the market for corporate control, discuss strategic issues related to firms' decision to acquire or be acquired, and examine the M&A regulatory environment.  We analyze various valuation and deal structure considerations, identify strategies that underlay a successful negotiation, and review the financial reporting and income tax implications of M&A transactions. In covering these and other related issues, we will discuss both the theory and practice of mergers and acquisitions. To provide some specific context we will analyze many large and small M&A deals. In discussing these cases, we will examine the situation faced by the company, the issues surrounding the transaction, including the financial implications, and focus on the managerial incentives and the judgment applied. Class time comprises mini lectures that introduce some of the more technical concepts, case discussions, and guest speakers who will offer additional perspectives on the subject matters. The course is co-taught by Ron Kasznik (GSB) and Safra Catz (Oracle Corporation). Ms. Catz is the CEO of Oracle Corporation and a member of its Board of Directors. She has led Oracle through more than 100 acquisitions in recent years (including PeopleSoft, Siebel, BEA, Sun Microsystems, and many more).

10,ACCT 516:,Analysis and Valuation of Emerging Market Firms,"This course examines the unique institutional, governance, and transparency issues affecting corporate valuations in emerging markets. Through lectures, case discussions and the students' real-time analysis of an emerging market firm, this condensed course is structured for students to gain a deeper understanding of the economic pressures behind the value creation, value destruction, and valuation process in emerging economies. The course focuses on critically interpreting financial and non-financial information for purposes of assessing firm fundamentals and risk in the presence of weak legal systems, strong political forces, limited investor protections, limited market development, strong macro-economic forces, opacity, and resultant business arrangements. The course is beneficial for investors, consultants, managers, and entrepreneurs operating in or considering expansion to developing markets.",Spr,2,"; Piotroski, J. (PI); Woodhall, E. (GP)"
11,ACCT 523:,Board Governance,"This course is focused on helping students understand the role boards and board members play in corporate governance and the lives of businesses large and small. This case-driven course is designed to help students who plan to serve on boards as private-equity or venture investors, entrepreneurs who will need to assemble and manage boards, and executives who realize they will need to interact with and answer to boards. The course is designed to help students understand the issues boards face both routine and non-routine through the eyes of the board member. By understanding the roles and responsibilities of board members and the mechanisms though which they exercise these duties, students will come away with an understanding of how boards function effectively (and in too many cases fail to function effectively). The course will include examining boards in a variety of contexts with a focus on three types of situations:  public for-profit companies, early-stage private companies, and not-for-profit companies of different sizes.",Last offered: Winter 2022,2,
12,ACCT 533:,Taxes and Business Strategy,"Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 20% to 40% of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, making the government one of the largest stakeholders. Taxes also affect a wide variety of business decisions, including the efficient formation of businesses, operational planning across jurisdictions with competing tax regimes, M&A tax structure, the creation of cash and equity compensation plans, and retirement planning (to name a few).  This course first provides a conceptual framework for incorporating taxation into business decisions, linking concepts from accounting, corporate finance, business law, and economics. The course then provides real-world examples to illustrate the impact of tax considerations on earnings and cash flows.  The goal of this course is to provide a foundational understanding of tax consequences and trade-offs that can be adapted across jurisdictions and as tax laws change.",Last offered: Winter 2014,0,

The range of applications includes: centralization vs delegation, static and dynamic contracting under moral hazard, Bayesian persuasion, and the optimal design of monitoring/auditing mechanisms.",Spr,3,"; Marinovic, I. (PI); Smeton, K. (GP)"
19,ACCT 618:,Market Efficiency and Informational Arbitrage,"The informational efficiency of stock markets has been a central theme in financial economic research in the past 50 years. Over this period, the focus of academic research has gradually shifted from the general to the more specific. While earlier studies tend to view the matter as a yes/no debate, most recent studies acknowledge the impossibility of fully efficient markets, and focus instead on analyses of factors that materially affect the timely incorporation of information into prices. At the same time, increasing attention is being paid to regulatory and market design issues that either impede or enhance market pricing efficiency.nIn this course, we will cover recent research on the role of informational arbitrage in asset pricing. Our starting point is the observation that, with costly information, equilibrium prices will invariably reflect some mispricing. The existence of mispricing introduces a role for informational arbitrage, whereby some traders will invest resources to become informed about the mispricing, with hopes of profiting from it. We review recent academic evidence on this process, and reflect on its implications for future market-related research. We will also discuss how academic research might help lower information/arbitrage costs.nThis is a doctoral level course. Our goal is not only to review existing research, but also to stimulate new work in the area. As such, I expect it will be of primary interest to Ph.D. students majoring in accounting, finance, and economics. Given our focus on returns prediction and the role of information in arbitrage strategies, this course should be of particular interest to those interested exploring the relation between information flows and market pricing dynamics. nThe course content is interdisciplinary in nature, spanning finance, economics, and accounting. Most of the readings in the earlier readings derive from finance and economics (market efficiency, limits to arbitrage, and behavioral finance); most of the later readings derive from financial accounting (equity valuation, fundamental analysis, earnings management, and analyst behavior).",Last offered: Winter 2021,3,

We examine the field from the perspective of an institutional investor (i.e. fund manager, investment advisor, endowment manager, head of a family office, etc). Our goal is to have students emerge with a practical and analytical framework for: 1. evaluating impact and mission-aligned investments across multiple asset classes and sectors; 2. constructing a portfolio using impact as a lens; 3. designing an impact investment company; and 4. understanding the many practical and theoretical challenges confronting this exciting emerging field.We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience.Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed.

Reputation Management will explore how you can effectively communicate to create, adapt and maintain your personal reputation. Your reputation remains fluid as you navigate your career decisions and interact with different professionals along your journey. The course is designed along three interlocking elements: reputation management literature, relevant case studies, and curated guest speakers. Students will learn the fundamentals of strategic corporate communication and the risk of not managing reputation effectively. These frameworks will be extended with specific case studies to illustrate where individuals, groups, and firms have faced the challenge of managing reputation effectively. We will focus on both traditional and virtual components of communication including the relevancy of online reputation management. Finally we will invite well-known leaders from a range of industries who have built and sustained their reputations, through effective communication. Each leader has had to manage their reputations in the public eye, and alongside their peers, supervisors, and employees. Guests will be invited to discuss their conscious and unplanned strategies of how to successfully communicate the kind of person, leader, innovator, or public figure they strive to be. Students will benefit from a rich blend of frameworks, cases, and speakers enabling them to successfully enter the work force and create their own, personal reputations. Students will create a case study drawn from their own experience (or personal network), of a reputation dilemma. A final assignment requires students to research their own reputation history by projecting what they think their reputation is, creating their own survey for friends, colleagues and employers to take, conduct three interviews about their personal reputation with three individuals who have worked closely with them, and then synthesize all this feedback into a cohesive paper and short video that reflects their authentic work and personal reputation.

94,GSBGEN 333:,Technology Licensing: Strategy and Negotiation,"Licensing of technology and its corresponding intellectual property is big business, and integral to the business plans and competitive strategies of start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike. Because licenses are complex agreements with important legal consequences, it is tempting for business executives to delegate to lawyers the negotiation of the 'non-economic terms' of their companies' technology license agreements. The problem with such an approach, however, is that at their core, issues of license structure, scope and risk require business judgments, and not merely legal ones. Do we need exclusive rights, and if so, to what, where and for how long? Will this prospective licensee bring our technology to market, and how do we mitigate the risk that it fails to do so? Can this licensor support our development efforts, and will it stand behind its IP in the event of a problem? Do we expose the guts of our technology to the world and try to protect it with patents, or do we keep it close and rely upon trade secrets? While counsel can offer advice on all these questions, they cannot know your business and competitive environment as you do, or be relied upon to optimize business trade-offs that must align not just with your company's present markets and strategies, but with those you expect it to pursue in the future. This course is organized around two hypothetical companies seeking to negotiate a technology license agreement. Divided into teams representing one or the other of these companies, students collaborate over multiple sessions to develop a strategic business approach and then to negotiate the critical terms of a licensing agreement. Lectures are focused on the business, and to a lesser extent, legal issues arising in complex licensing arrangements, and are designed to give students the context and perspective they need to participate effectively in licensing strategy development and negotiation. By immersing teams of business students in a multi-session licensing negotiation, it is the objective of this course to enable them to better understand and more effectively navigate the strategic business issues that arise in the conceptualization and negotiation of technology license agreements.",Last offered: Autumn 2022,3,

In such a world, it appears pointless to build an institution ¿ a social arrangement that is stable and long-lived, created and maintained to serve a shared purpose that cannot be achieved by individuals acting alone. Indeed, in a world transfixed by the allure of new technology, institutions are viewed as obstacles that must be routed around. Or disrupted. Or destroyed. This course takes a different view: institutions are essential to a well-functioning society. In the commercial world, institutions are what we refer to as enduring enterprises. The course will explore why and how to turn a company into an institution, whether that company is a family firm (the primary form of enduring enterprise), startup, growth business, professional services partnership, or legacy corporation. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business Cofra Holding. The course is intended for three main audiences: (1) Students from a family firm who may or may not want to work at that firm.

The goal of the course is to provide students with both theoretical and hands-on understanding of important energy and environmental market concepts that are critical to market functioning but not always widely appreciated. Concepts covered include: 1)regulated price-setting versus price-setting through market mechanisms, 2) BTU arbitrage in input energy choices, 3) uniform price vs. pay-as-bid auctions, 4) the ability and incentive to exercise unilateral market power, 5) unilateral versus coordinated exercise of market power, 6) transmission congestion, 7) forward contracts and their effect on market functioning, 8) dynamic pricing of electricity and active involvement of final demand, 9)the nature of energy reserves, 10) carbon pricing mechanisms including taxes and cap-and trade systems, 11) renewable portfolio standards and other renewable energy incentives,12) determination of levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and its impact on new capacity investment decisions, and 13) interactions between environmental mechanisms and regulations. We will also discuss the key features of the markets for major sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, solar, wind, and biomass.

The second part begins with integrated assessment models and reasons for disagreement among prominent models.  (Students are expected to understand public goods dilemmas and free-riding.)  It then proceeds to an obvious but often overlooked basic and essential fact: these models upon which all activist and government actions are based are unrealistic academic exercises.  They are not even asking the right questions.  Thus, United Nations treaties and carbon footprint initiatives are distractions rather than solutions.  The third part discusses where clean and other technology is as of 2022 and what it will still take to reduce global warming.  It also discusses why some prominently proposed technologies are hopeless, too; while other cheaper actions have remained unused (lost opportunities).

105,GSBGEN 357:,U.S.-China: Strategic Competition and Cooperation,"This is a course to help future business leaders understand the policy risks that result from the changing relationship between the United States and China. Driven in part by policy decisions over the past decade in Washington and Beijing, the world built by the West after World War II is changing. Most American policymakers now label the relationship between the U.S. and China as one of strategic competition. They are often less clear on whether this term applies to the governments, the peoples, the businesses based within each country, or the two nation-states. At the same time, these two superpowers also have shared interests. We seek to understand the changing relationships between the U.S. and China, and what both competition and possible cooperation between their governments mean for others. American business leaders may be caught between two governments with conflicting interests. Business leaders in other countries may be caught among three governments: America, China, and their home-country government. This is a course not about China per se, but instead about the interactions between these two superpowers' governments and policies. We will look at the U.S.-China relationship by unpacking and examining distinct elements, devoting 1 or 2 class sessions on each topic. Relying in part on guests with practical expertise in some element of the U.S.-China relationship, our goals are to understand: * The most significant changes in Chinese policy direction in the Xi era; * Changes among Western leaders' policy approaches as they have realized their 50-year-old policy toward China either was wrong or is now out-of-date; * What the strategic competition label might mean and how it could translate into specific policy changes in both countries; * What opportunities exist for cooperation and mutual benefit despite strategic competition; * How China might try to change the post-WWII international rules and organizations; * How leaders of global businesses, in the U.S., China, and other countries, are caught between these two governments; * What decoupling in certain industries might mean; and * Possible ways to think about these issues as the U.S.-China relationship evolves.",Spr,4,"; Hennessey, K.

We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience. Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed. While first year students are encouraged to enroll, students who have limited familiarity with the basics of investing and corporate finance are strongly encouraged to purchase David Swensen's ""Pioneering Portfolio Management"" and cover the recommended chapters in advance of the course. It's is also important to note that this class will require financial modeling and detailed investment analysis. Many of the issues we'll be tackling have no unambiguous answers. Lively discussion and debate will be necessary and expected. This course is a 2-unit version of GSBGEN 305.",Win,2,"; Patel, H. (PI); Ewald, C. (SI); Fajardo Montes, M. (GP)"
126,GSBGEN 508:,Strategic Pivoting for your Next Chapter,"Many students come to the GSB with the intent to pivot upon leaving the institution.  Some students feel they have outgrown their position or business, or they feel drawn to a new area that better suits their values and interests, where they can make a greater contribution. Some students have no idea what they want to do after graduating, they just know they want to make a purposeful change. And finally, some students want to strategically change their direction for reputation reasons.  The average U.S. employee tenure is only 4-5 years and job roles often change dramatically within that timeframe. Pivoting is an intentional, methodical process for nimbly navigating career changes.  A recent Gallup study revealed that almost 90% of workers are either 'not engaged' or 'actively disengaged' from their jobs. A pivot is a change made of your own volition when you have reached a point in your career when you are ready for increased challenge and impact. Strategic Pivoting is a course specifically developed for any student who already plans to pivot in their career and wants to figure out how to successfully build and create their next chapter. In this course we will discuss four stages for how to best pivot:  1) Planting, how to assess and set a strong foundation of values, strengths and interests. 2)  Scanning, researching new and related skills, talking to others, and mapping potential opportunities. 3) Piloting, students conduct small, low-risk experiments to test their new direction, as well as gather real-time data and feedback. And 4) Launching, pulling the trigger, fully committed, to your carefully plotted pivot. The ultimate pay-off to Strategic Pivoting is acknowledging and adapting to a rapidly changing society when it comes to career paths. Because our careers are so fundamentally tied to our livelihood and sense of confidence, purpose and meaning, changes can be traumatic without a road map for traversing them. ""Navigating this accelerated pace of change and this transitional career state, and learning to embrace it instead of resisting it, can become an edge and advantage.""  Alex Rodriguez, Major League Baseball icon, ABC/Fox Sports/ESPN commentator, entrepreneur, and CEO of A-Rod Corp will be a featured Guest Speaker in this course. Alex has also had a history of successfully pivoting his career and defying expectations. He is presently getting ready to host his own ESPN interview show called, ""Pivot.""",Win,2,"; Kluger, A.

127,GSBGEN 514:,Creating and Scaling High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies (Cases),"GSBGEN 514 - Creating High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies (2 Units) This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching and growing high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments. GSBGEN 514 is a seminar/discussion format in which students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. A framework based on the World Economic Forum (WEF) report on ""Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics"" will be used to structure the course. Each student will prepare a short write-up as a final assignment on a case chosen from a selection provided by the instructors. Note: Groups of students who want to work as a team to investigate a specific new venture idea in addition to participating in the seminar/discussion sessions should also consider enrolling in GSB534, offered in Spring term.",Spr,2,"; Ciesinski, S.

Together, we will explore questions such as: What is the role of philanthropy and the social sector in a society dominated by markets and the public sector? Do philanthropists achieve their goals, and why or why not? To what extent do current movements - such as trust-based philanthropy, participatory philanthropy, and effective altruism - advance best practices? How might different forms of charitable support - including traditional grants, advocacy and lobbying dollars, and impact investments, - be deployed to maximize progress towards achieving impact goals? What are the tradeoffs between direct grantmaking, collaborative philanthropy, and philanthropic intermediaries? How should philanthropists think about giving today versus giving in the future? Should the rules governing philanthropy be amended to enhance its effectiveness? Our class conversations will be supported by the insights and experiences of a number of invited guests, including distinguished philanthropists and other social sector leaders.",Win,2,"; Wolfson, M.

Most companies are not started by MBAs; most startups are not funded by VCs; most employees don't work for tech firms; and most firms don't sell out to other businesses or go public. Rather, the vast majority of companies world-wide are started, funded, owned, and governed by families, and these firms create most of the employment in the global economy. Despite the prominence of family firms, most MBA courses focus on the widely-held or Silicon Valley model of the firm. This course explores the challenges and opportunities faced by family businesses. It is co-taught by Leo Linbeck III, Lecturer since 2005 at the GSB and President and CEO of Aquinas Companies, LLC, and Thomas Brenninkmeijer, a leader in his family business of Cofra Holdings AG.

While acknowledging the importance of shareholder value, commentators have argued that corporations should purposively benefit other stakeholders, including customers, employees, and the communities they affect (stakeholderism). At the same time, there has been an upswing of investments aligned with investors' social interests, including public equity investments in companies with high environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and private equity 'impact investments' that typically incur greater risks than pure risk-adjusted market rate investments. This course will consider a variety of legal, ethical, and policy issues related to corporations' purposes and responsibilities, including: the meanings and measures of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ESG criteria; disclosure of a company's environmental and social harms or risks; when is it legally and ethically appropriate for corporate managers or institutional investors to compromise shareholder value in the pursuit of social, environmental and other non-pecuniary goals; constituency statutes and benefit corporations that reflect interests other than profit maximization; the power of investors to influence corporate behavior through affirmative investments, divestments and shareholder activism; the power of various stakeholder groups to influence corporate behavior; proposals for broadening the purpose of corporations; barriers to these various practices and proposals; and whether they can be accommodated within a neoliberal framework or require a new framework.",Last offered: Spring 2023,2,

This will include examining the major elements of storytelling. The class will also look in depth at the rapidly changing business of entertainment. The class will cover leadership in entertainment, the international scene, writing, directing, producing, television showrunning, managing creatives, and other key aspects of the industry.

The entertainment industry is one of enormous importance - both from a business and cultural standpoint, and has influence on virtually every sphere of our society. Sometimes the industry can seem baffling, mercurial, and characterized more by madness than method. But despite its uncertainties, Hollywood does have its own rules, rhythms, methods and strategies - and examining and evaluating them will be a part of this seminar. This is a time when many existing formulas are being reconsidered, retooled, or jettisoned, and rising technologies such as AI, and expanding international markets are having a profound impact on the industry - and tracking and analyzing this will be a significant part of the course. I will also bring some of my professional experiences into the classroom (including directing, writing, and producing for film and television, etc.), and discuss these experiences through the intersection of the business and creative sides of the industry. We will discuss the entertainment industry's future, and address varied and effective paths for creating entertainment product with artistic and/or commercial merit.

148,GSBGEN 565:,Political Communication: How Leaders Become Leaders,"This year -- 2024 -- will be a fascinating backdrop for national as well as state and local politics. Implications of the current polarized electorate, the economic climate and an uneven but recovering economy, Inflation fears, wars in Ukraine and Gaza will continue to complicate the political landscape. At the apex of political interest will be the American Presidential and Congressional elections. Politics, perhaps like no other arena, provides a rich and dramatic laboratory for studying the art and science of influential communication. Whether it is a local school bond election or a Congressional race, a Presidential debate or a State of the Union Address, the demanding communications of politics provide insights into our own strengths and gaps as communicators and leaders. Political campaigns, by their very nature, are highly visible, oriented toward very specific objectives, and increasingly leverage a variety of new media platforms. They are often emotionally charged, and rife with conflict and drama. The principles foundational to political communications transcend politics, and are useful guides for leaders in business, the non-profit community, as well as government. How candidates, elected officials, and leaders in all kinds of organizations communicate vision, values, and experience, as well as how they perform in very fluid environments, not the least of which may be during a crisis, has a great deal to do with their career success. In its 16th year, this highly interactive course allows students to explore both theory and practice behind effective positioning and presentation. Students will analyze and evaluate both successful and unsuccessful communications strategies of political campaigns and candidates. History is an impactful learning tool, something emphasized throughout the class. As such, students will explore historic examples of US Presidential debates, from Nixon/Kennedy to the present, as well other political events from the near and distant past. Popular culture, the effect of social media, disinformation will also be topics of discussion. Students will experience discussion of political events as they happen -- with each class drawing lessons from political developments around the nation and the world. Students will also hone their own strategic communications skills in activities requiring both written and spoken communication. This is not a course in political science, American government, or in public speaking. However, the engaged student will gain insights into those areas as well. The course is taught by David Demarest, former Vice President of Public Affairs for Stanford University. Demarest has broad communications experience across the public and private sector in financial services, education, and government. Typically, Prof. Demarest shares many of his experiences -- some successful, some less so -- through storytelling, and while those stories may be entertaining, they also provide real-life examples of communications challenges and strategies, After serving as Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, and Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Reagan Administration, in 1988 he served as Communications Director for Vice President George H. W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. He then became a member of the White House senior staff as White House Communications Director. After leaving government in 1993, he spent the next decade leading communications for two Fortune 50 companies, before coming to Stanford in 2005 to head the university's public affairs efforts.","Aut, Win",2,"; Demarest, D.

149,GSBGEN 566:,Dilemmas and Decisions,"GSBGEN 566 is an elective course offered to 2nd-year MBA and MSx students. The goal of this course is to improve students' judgment in confronting challenging, real business situations encountered in the normal progression of corporate activities. The course aims to sharpen moral reasoning and build judgment without favoring a particular position. The course will be taught by Mark Leslie and Peter Levine, Lecturers. The course is taught using 'vignettes'. At the beginning of each class students will be given a one-page reading that describes a business situation which requires a decision to be made.  After in-depth discussion, a second page will be handed out, describing how the situation actually unfolded and challenges the class with new information.  This new information typically changes the dynamics of the case and requires a new decision to be made.  Often there is a third and fourth page that continues the dialogue.  Frequent student-to-student and student-to-instructor role-playing will be employed in the development of the session.  Note that for most classes there is little or no advanced preparation required, which is often the case when making real-world business decisions. Cases are drawn from a wide selection of ACTUAL BUSINESS SITUATIONS with protagonists joining the class as guests whenever available.  Vignettes are based on topics such as raising venture capital, managing major industrial customers, product distribution agreements, board of director and fiduciary conflicts, developing financial instruments, palace revolt / mutiny, work/life balance, rape accusation of an executive, etc. The class is extremely engaging - it is quite usual to find continuing discussion of the day's case outside the classroom among small groups of students. This class is for two GSB credits and will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Sixty percent of the final grade will be derived from classroom performance; the remainder will be based on a final written assignment describing a personal ethical situation that the student has faced in their careers.",Last offered: Autumn 2021,2,

Many of today's philanthropic institutions operate with unprecedented innovation and influence and lead in a way that rapidly adapts to society's ever-evolving needs, issues and crises. In this course we will look at the different types of philanthropic institutions (including foundations, LLCs and corporate philanthropy) that are driving this innovation and the diverse models that shape their operations and grantmaking. We will explore how to create philanthropic strategy, investment criteria, social change goals, short-, intermediate- and long-term indicators of success as well as how each of these factors merge to drive a unique grantmaking process. Students will drill down into the best practices of grantee-centric philanthropy as well as how to comprehensively assess nonprofits, evaluate grant proposals and make strategic funding recommendations. We will hear from globally renowned and new generation philanthropic leaders implementing the most innovative and impactful approaches across issue areas including climate change, movement building, policy change, voting rights, the arts and education, all through the lens of justice. Speakers will potentially include Laura Muñoz Arnold (Arnold Foundation), Crystal Hayling and Ashley Clark (Libra Foundation), Hal Harvey (Energy Innovation), Justin Steele (Google.org) and Jon Stryker (Arcus Foundation).

155,GSBGEN 587:,Policy Practicum:  Alabama Innovation,"Client: Innovate Alabama, https://innovatealabama.org/.  The newly established Alabama Innovation Commission, known as Innovate Alabama, has sought policy recommendations from a group of faculty at Stanford University, including representatives from Stanford Law School and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The goal of the Alabama Innovation Commission is to identify and present to policymakers policies that will promote innovation, entrepreneurship, economic development, and high-skilled jobs in the state. In this policy lab, students will work on papers whose results will be incorporated with attribution into the recommendations provided to the Commission and the Governor. Where possible, projects will be conducted in partnership with students at the major research universities in Alabama. Available topics for projects include building on the state's existing competencies in medical research and space and defense technology; assessing financial incentives for attracting businesses; deploying broadband-based education; fostering the role of universities in economic development; and drawing high-skilled workers through opportunities for outdoor recreation.  Students admitted to the lab will work on one of the following projects (to be determined according to the priorities of the client):  1.) Business Incentives and Prosperity. High profile competitions for the headquarters of large corporations often lead states to offer large incentive packages. States that land the deal are often perceived as the winners. Some recruitment initiatives indeed bring substantial local economic benefits, yet recent research has called into question many commonly-held beliefs about state incentives. Such incentives often may have costs that exceed benefits, and there is some question even as to whether they increase local economic activity at the margin in most cases. This project will evaluate Alabama's existing incentives for attracting businesses and make recommendations based on the successes and failures of recent incentive programs around the country. The project will weigh the potential for traditional recruitment tactics such as tax incentives and subsidized industrial sites against alternatives such as infrastructure development, skills development programs, and customized business services. (S. Haber and J. Rauh).  2.) Deploying Broadband-Based Education. The future of Alabama rests on the talent and knowledge of its citizens so the success of K-12 public education must be a potent driver of human capital development.  The work of the Stanford-AL team will look at the current and potential for deploying broadband-based education throughout the state to augment the current capacities of K-12 educators to deliver high quality instruction, especially in the priority areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) which ties in closely to economic development plans for the state. (M. Raymond).  3.) Fostering the Role of Universities. It is widely recognized that universities are key to the development of innovative economic activity at the state and local level. The most productive local innovation economies in the US have emerged in locations such as Silicon Valley, North Carolina's Research Triangle, and the Boston area, powered by research that has emerged from local universities. Success stories of the impact of universities on the innovative ecosystem also abound in smaller markets in recent decades. This project will aim to make specific, concrete recommendations for state government policy to build on the strength of Alabama's universities to grow Alabama's technology and innovation economy. (R. Banks and J. Rauh).  4.) The Outdoor Recreation Lab. Persuading someone to move thousands of miles to a new home, a new community, and a new state is not an event; it is a process. It often starts with a short visit that plants a seed in a person's mind. Those crucial, initial, short visits often occur because of tourism; and when it comes to people who have invested in human capital that is specific to high technology industries, that tourism tends to be focused on outdoor recreation. Outdoor recreation tourism is not, however, simply a way to draw high-skilled workers into a state; it is also a way to share the economic rents generated by high tech industries with rural areas. It is the working hypothesis of the Outdoor Recreation Lab that Alabama's Cumberland Plateau has necessary environmental characteristics to be a draw for high tech workers and entrepreneurs/and thus be an important part of building and sustaining a more innovative Alabama economy--but that potential has not been fully developed. The purpose of the Outdoor Recreation Lab is to assess the hypothesis that the Cumberland Plateau is an underdeveloped resource for the State of Alabama. Specifically, the lab will assess its natural endowments as compared to its physical and business infrastructure. An important component of this assessment is the extent of public lands, the interpretation of ""public trust"" in Alabama law regarding access to navigable rivers and streams, and the number and identity of agencies that would have to be coordinated to provide access to those lands and waterways.  It will also learn about the attempts--both successful and not--by other states to leverage natural endowments to generate in-migration by tech workers and entrepreneurs. (S. Haber).  Additional sub-projects if students are interested may include deep dives into how Alabama can build on existing competencies in Medical Research and in Space/Defense technology to foster the further development of its economy and technology center.  The lab seeks students from the law and business schools, the graduate MS&E program, and other graduate students with a background in entrepreneurship and/or local governance. Students who have ties to Alabama are especially invited to apply.  Elements used in grading:  Attendance, Performance, Class Participation, Written Assignments.  Cross-listed with the Law School.

In this course we will explore the workings of these interactions and the challenges they present for societies around the globe. As specific examples, we will discuss the 21st century economic and political forces affecting internet governance, global supply chains, and the workings of different legal systems. We will see how the competence and integrity of people and institutions, their respect of human rights, and the structure and effectiveness of governance and accountability mechanisms in the private and the public sectors, are key determinants of the outcomes. At one extreme, people and institutions may be highly effective but lack concern for human rights. At the other extreme, compassionate individuals and institutions might be ineffective or incompetent. It is also a truism that power can corrupt and may be abused. In fact, standard success metrics in business and in government, combined with weak governance mechanisms, may encourage and enable such abuse.

At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, we must be intentional about human-centered design because, 'Only once we have thought hard about what sort of future we want, will we be able to begin steering a course toward a desirable future. If we don't know what we want, we're unlikely to get it.' Thus, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being?  The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework:·has a clear and meaningful purpose  ·augments human dignity and autonomy ·creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration· creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence)Toward this end, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a final project and propose a solution that tackles a significant societal challenge by leveraging technology and frameworks on human thriving.",Last offered: Winter 2021,2,

Indeed, highly ineffective charities persist for decades even in the presence of far more effective alternatives engaged in identical activities.  The same people who are quick to give when asked are even quicker to 'avoid the ask' or take advantage of a plausible excuse.  And, we often care deeply not just whether someone did a good turn but their motive for doing it.  We'll discuss the origins of human generosity and its accompanying quirks, and also develop practical takeaways in the form of guidance for the design of interventions to motivate more altruistic behaviors.

This course offers an in-depth look at how diverse levers, from carbon markets to legislative and regulatory mandates to grassroots movements, are accelerating the adoption of climate solutions. The course begins with the origins of international climate policy in the Kyoto and Paris Agreements, which have created an international consensus around national carbon targets. We look at how the development of both regulated and voluntary carbon markets offer potentially significant means of meeting net zero goals, the former by setting a regional price on carbon as compliance markets take off around the world, the latter by financing technological advancement and providing capital flows for unfunded climate projects in the Global South. In parallel, we explore how a range of policy measures from air and water regulations to state mandates for battery storage, energy efficiency, and renewable energy to federal tax incentives have bent the curve on domestic carbon emissions. We look at how new trade policies based on carbon intensity have the potential to create a virtuous circle across supply chains. And we evaluate the role that investors, organized labor, consumers and grassroots movements have played in much of this work. Lastly, the course covers how technology is increasingly enabling decarbonization mechanisms (eg through digital monitoring of the environment) and how our growing understanding of the carbon cycle, including sophisticated nature-based and engineered carbon removal solutions, is opening a whole new sector of climate tech and transition investment.

During interactive classes, you will contemplate prominent leadership theories, compare the efficacy of selection methodologies, conduct behavior-based interviews, and debate selection decisions. Assessing leadership capability also is the foundation for developing exceptional talent. This class employs an experiential modality, teaching you how to assess leadership capability by applying what you learn to your own leadership development. Using 360 input from supervisors, peers, and subordinates, you will identify which leadership behaviors are most critical for you to develop further. Through 1-1 coaching, you will wrestle with the beliefs and assumptions that may be limiting your influence and constraining your future growth. In your final paper, you will revisit what matters most to you and how you can channel this motivation to expand your leadership capability and your impact post GSB. Through this class, you will deepen your understanding of assessment, sharpen your evaluation instincts, and learn how to spot transformational growth opportunities for yourself and for others.",Win,2,"; Moss, K.

181,GSBGID 503:,The University (and Other Organizations) in Crisis,"In addition to having leadership roles in corporations, investment firms, and other organizations, today's MBAs will be tomorrow's university trustees and major donors. They will find many of these institutions in a state of crisis involving identity, equality, and discourse. During the past half century, American universities and the leadership of major corporations have evolved from being largely white, male, and Protestant to becoming more diverse in many ways. However, some of the policies that have contributed to this progress are being abandoned or distorted. For example, the Supreme Court recently prohibited race-based affirmative action, a major vehicle for achieving diversity. And diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, originally designed to counter discrimination based on individuals' identities, have sometimes become vehicles for creating stark divisions among people with different identities. The university's missions of seeking truth and engaging in critical inquiry have been undermined by both progressive and conservative actors. Affective polarization has dramatically increased, and civil and critical discourse are in steep decline throughout society's institutions. Controversies about the war in Gaza have only exacerbated these problems. We will examine the nature and causes of these and related problems, and consider possible solutions for reducing polarization, restoring discourse, and achieving genuine equality. Although our main focus will be on institutions of higher education, we will also examine these issues in corporations and other organizational settings. In the conduct of the class, we will try to model civil, critical discourse. Students who opt to take the course for a grade will write a paper of approximately 10 single-spaced pages on any topic related to the course. Students who opt to take the course on a pass/fail basis will be assessed based on four reflection papers.

Those who will be caregivers, and those who will need a caregiver.' -- Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. We have a broken care system in the U.S.  Americans spend $648 billion annually on care, and it is expected to grow. There is a significant labor shortage of trained caregivers. Currently, 53 million Americans serve as unpaid family caregivers to someone who is aging, ill, or living with a disability. The childcare market is similarly unaffordable, fragmented, and broken.  Every business leader today is confronting the complexities of a workforce of young parents, often challenged to find care for their children and/or their parents and family members. These markets, often referred to as the Care Economy, are overlooked and ripe for reinvention with the potential for enormous social impact.  This course will expose students to key insights about the Care Economy from the perspective of entrepreneurs, investors, caregivers, and business leaders. We will explore the spectrum of care needs, from children to older adults, and how other developed economies such as Singapore, Denmark and Japan have created their care systems and addressed the needs of working families. During the course, students will meet several distinguished thought leaders working to build a better care system, including the CEO of a leading care navigation company, major investors in the care economy, key business leaders spearheading public-private partnerships for caregiving, and policy innovators.  The course will include cases, panels with entrepreneurs, class exercises, and lectures. Class topics will include:-How employers¿ support for employees with caregiving responsibilities can benefit their organization.-Understanding the breadth of industries and services that encompass the Care Economy. -Learning about the ¿triangle¿ of payors, purchasers and users of care services and products.-Identifying the different needs and complexities of caring for infants, children, older adults. -The Care Economy innovation ecosystem: opportunities, challenges, and best practices.-The important role of policy, both within organizations as well as local, state and national initiatives, to create a better care system for people from their 'first breath to their last.'",Win,2,"; Golden, S.

You will learn about a variety of tools which allow you to (1) better understand understanding what is happening in an organization, (2) forecast what is likely to happen in the future, based on sophisticated extrapolation of past data, and (3) prototype (i.e., conduct organizational A/B tests) to determine which decisions are likely to be successful based on pilot tests. These tools make for a major departure from the mainstream approach to organization design, which relies extensively on copying ¿best practices¿ from other companies, represents organizations as ¿boxes and arrows¿ organization charts, and is often obsessed with incentive compensation and reporting as the key organizational/HR decisions. Instead, you will learn how to use analytics to find out what works specifically for your company (rather than what worked in others), develop detailed models of interactions among employees (rather than among boxes) to help them collaborate successfully, and think of organization design as a combination of factors which can all be better understood through analytics. The course's goals are to make you more knowledgeable about the analytical tools which can help you design an organization, to give you frameworks to ask the right questions to data scientists and evaluate their work, and to help you make decisions based on the results of analyses. This is a hands-on class: we will rely extensively on group exercises, in which you will be able to learn enough about analytical tools and programming to be able to collaborate with analysts and evaluate their work. Who should take this course? If you are likely to be involved in strategy execution, post-merger integration, re-organizations, or HR in either a direct or advisory role (regardless of how big or small your company is), this course will put you at the cutting edge of thinking and methodology in these areas.

Indeed, though U.S. income inequality has increased, inequality has fallen around the world. However, by developed country standards, poverty remains pervasive. What has caused the decline in rates of poverty and can we expect further decreases or can we act to accelerate the improvements? One answer is that countries that have experienced 'inclusive growth'?, in which the growth of the economy (i.e., GDP) has elevated the incomes of the poor, have done better at creating jobs for the poor, especially in the private sector. Therefore, the class will consider the evidence on the factors that have contributed to inclusive economic growth in developing countries. A second answer as to why poverty has fallen, but remains at high levels, is that governments and aid agencies and foundations have targeted programs to the poor.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing formula is significantly more tractable than discrete- time methods of option pricing based on binomial trees. There is an established tradition in continuous-time asset pricing, and there is increasing use of these methods in other fields, such as game theory, contract theory, market microstructure and macroeconomics.  The goal of this class is to explore some of the old classic research as well as new economic models, and to discover areas of economics where continuous-time methods can help. The intention is to give graduate students a tool, which they can use to gain comparative advantage in their research, when they see appropriate.  With this goal in mind, 25% of the class will focus on mathematics, but with economically relevant examples to illustrate the mathematical results. Up to one half of the class will cover established models, and the rest will focus on new papers. If students have their own work that uses continuous time, we can take a look at that as well. Coursework will include biweekly problem sets and a short final research project.

In addition to understanding how to analyze conflict and negotiation situations, to manage effectively, you must have a broad repertoire of behavioral skills that can be applied to the various conflict and negotiation situations you are likely to encounter. Therefore, a second aim of the course is to allow you to experience various bargaining situations by playing a role in simulated negotiations. Our exercises will allow you to try out tactics that might feel uncomfortable trying in an actual negotiation, get constructive feedback from your counterparts and classmates, and learn how you come across.

OB330 and OB331 together are the academic component of this program and run the entirety of both Autumn and Winter Quarters. Students earn 4 credits in the Autumn and 4 credits in the Winter. Both quarters must be completed to receive any units of credit. The course is open only to those students who have applied and been accepted into the Leadership Fellows Program. Interested students apply at the start of Winter Quarter of their first year and undergo a competitive application process, after which successful applicants are invited to take part in the program. Informational meetings are held late in Autumn Quarter and during the first week of Winter Quarter and Fellows are selected from the first year class in mid- Winter Quarter. Knowing how to develop others is a crucial leadership competency. In this class, Fellows develop the advanced leadership skills of leading leaders and developing others through coaching and mentoring. Among the competencies developed in this class are Team Coaching, Individual Coaching and Personal Development skills. In the Autumn Quarter Fellows are assigned to a squad of six MBA1s in Leadership Labs. Fellows guide their MBA1 squad through the learning process in the Labs and provide both individual and team coaching to their MBA1 squad members. In addition to the work with their MBA 1 squad, Fellows provide in-depth 1:1 coaching to three additional MBA1 students who are not members of their squad as part of the Personal Leadership Coaching (PLC) program. The PLC coaching begins after Autumn midterms and continues through the end of Winter Quarter. Fellows classes meet twice a week for 105 minutes. There will be a reading list of conceptual material which will be supplemented during class with lectures discussions and activities. Students will apply concepts through role-playing and experiential exercises during class time as well as in their coaching and mentoring of their MBA1 coachees.

The course begins by situating cultural leadership and management within a culture-shaping framework and the opportunities, obligations and methods for leaders to impact culture. It also focuses on what is different in cultural management and why so many contemporary firms attempt to use it. We analyze the relationship between culture and strategy, seeking alignment between the two. The course also explores different kinds of cultures seen in high performing and low performing organizations, and seeks to understand how cultural content affects behavior and business results. Students will be asked to describe and define the culture of an organization needed for a given business and strategy, and to define the role of executives in shaping culture. The class identifies and analyzes the tools or levers that leaders can use to build an effective culture. We will spend a session on each of the following: culture and strategy alignment, architecture for shaping culture, selecting people for cultural alignment, aligning organizational practices, culture and society, cultural inflection points from start-up to scale, cultural aspects of high performance and cultural diagnostics.

This course is an attempt to help you answer that question. I define self-coaching as the process of guiding our own growth and development, particularly through periods of transition, in both the professional and personal realms. In this course you'll explore a range of practices and disciplines intended to help you build on what you've learned about yourself at the GSB and continue that process after graduation. Classes will consist of a mix of short lectures, exercises, small group discussions, and conversations in pairs. While this is a self-directed process, it's also highly social and interactive. You'll work with in pairs and small groups in every class session, so be prepared to discuss meaningful personal issues with your fellow students. Because every class session involves extensive interaction with other students, missing a class would negatively affect other students' learning.

For example, an organizational culture emerges through interactions of individuals within the formal and informal social networks of the organization. But once established, such a culture can determine the nature of interactions between individuals. Theories of social capital, influence, power and relational sociology speak to these types of problems; social network analysis provides tools to approach them rigorously. This course will have four modules designed to make you a confident creator and skeptical consumer of social network research. We'll start with definitions and fundamental results from graph theory. We'll then situate social networks within sociological (and adjacent) theory before covering some approaches for (and challenges of) collecting and working with empirical network data.

We will then examine how culture affects basic psychological processes, including cognition, emotion, and motivation, followed by how culture affects organizational phenomena. In the last five weeks of the class, we will examine how culture affects topics in organizational behavior, which will be chosen by the class. This class will increase your knowledge about other cultures, and will enable you to critically examine the cultural assumptions embedded in existing organizational theories. It will also provide tools for you to be able to develop and test your own theories in other cultures.

This is the defining question of the interdisciplinary research field known as ""strategic management"". In this PhD seminar, we will survey the field of strategic management as seen from the perspective of 'macro' organizational behavior. The course takes a broad view of the field of strategic management, reflecting the diversity of perspectives that is seen in this field worldwide. Across this diversity, however, it is possible to identify four distinct theoretical approaches by noting the mechanisms that researchers think are generating outcomes.  The course is structured around these four theoretical approaches, and one of the main objectives of the course is to help you identify, critique, and improve these theoretical approaches. Most work in strategic management pays less attention to particular theoretical perspectives, and is organized more by the topic - the phenomenon being studied - such as market exit, growth, performance, mergers and acquisitions, innovation, and the like. I have catalogued the research in strategic management both according to theoretical perspective and topic, and the skeleton of that structure can be seen in this syllabus.

Because most organizations are not democracies, movements must find ways to penetrate their closed boundaries if they are to have an influence inside organizations. At the same time, social movements create organizational structures that help them carry out their goals, reproduce their missions and tactics, and effectively generate collective action.  The purpose of this course is to examine the complex relationship between social movements and organizations. In order to understand the empirical link between movements and organizations, we will rely on social movement and organizational theory. Like the phenomena they seek to explain, these theories are strongly intertwined. In this course, we will cover topics related to how movements use organizations to propel change, and topics related to how movements help generate social change by targeting organizations. We will also evaluate the theoretical developments at the nexus of these two literatures, identifying the major innovations as well as looking for new research opportunities.",Last offered: Winter 2022,3,

It aims to identify not only how recent innovations in computational theory can provide new ways of understanding social systems as computational systems, but also how social systems can provide new ways of understanding the structure and nature of computation itself. It covers foundational discoveries in CSS to date that are grounded in well-defined mathematical and/or simulation-based models, as well as successfully validated with empirical data from experiments and observational studies. Each class is organized to examine a potential feature and/or dynamic of social systems that may (or may not, as we shall discuss) be considered a defining constitutive characteristic of uniquely social computation. The features/dynamics covered in the seminar include social network structure, social contagion and diffusion (i.e., the spread of ideas and behaviors through populations), collective intelligence and the wisdom of crowds, conventions and social norms, categories and analogies, cultural markets and path dependent historical evolution, innovation, ranking systems, and search processes, and the macro dynamics of organizations that coordinate and aggregate collective cognition and behavior. The penultimate class reviews current efforts to use large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence more generally to imitate human agents in controlled psychological tasks and simulated social network environments, with the aim of examining (i) whether these artificial agents can serve as viable models for predicting, identifying, and explaining the computational dynamics of social systems, and (ii) whether these models can be improved toward this end using the theory of social computation explored in this seminar.",Win,3,"; Guilbeault, D.

The class is taught in an interactive style, focusing on applications drawn from advertising, healthcare, finance, supply chain management, revenue management and pricing, scheduling, and risk management. There are several differences with 245 and 247 that are worth emphasizing. The first difference is in the pace and depth: OIT 248 covers each topic significantly faster and at a deeper level; as such, the class requires slightly more mathematical sophistication (for instance, the ability to quickly digest mathematical formulas and equations). A second difference is that OIT 248 leverages Python instead of Excel for implementation. (We emphasize that OIT 248 uses Python to teach analytics, but is not a course on Python or coding. Although no prior coding experience in Python is required, every student in Advanced is expected to have had some prior coding experience, for instance, through coursework, in their prior jobs, etc.) Lastly, a third difference is that OIT 248 devotes more time to discussing practical issues that arise in real-world, data-driven implementations; so by the end of the course, students should develop a more in-depth mental framework of the topics and leave with a good understanding of how they fit within modern machine-learning / AI pipelines that aid decision-making in complex problems.",Aut,3,"; Iancu, D.

360,OIT 677:,Stochastic Modeling for Data-Driven Decision Making,"In many application areas, practical data-driven decision making benefits from the use of stochastic models. These models help provide structural insights into core system dynamics, and constrain how the effects of various interventions may (or may not) propagate through the target system. However, choosing the right model amongst a vast space of alternative approaches can be a daunting challenge. Through representative examples, including optimal targeting, dynamic learning and stochastic resource allocation, this class examines how various modeling approaches inform data collection, system analysis and ultimately, optimal decision making. Emphasis will be placed on synthesizing generalizable best practices for stochastic modeling in dynamic and/or data-intensive applications.",Spr,3,"; Wager, S. (PI); Rivera, S. (GP)"

These premises do not posit that we are irrational. Such claims are wildly off the mark; they cannot explain how we have become the dominant species on this planet. Instead, they describe a clever but computationally constrained primate whose evolution, cultural as well as biological, has produced a characteristic configuration of mental software and external symbol systems (writing, numbers). The representational and computational capacities of this software and these symbol systems, combined with our unusual ability to cooperate with unrelated strangers, has in a remarkably short time produced massive knowledge-intensive political institutions that can deploy nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and can use epidemiology and molecular genetics to combat epidemics. Such achievements warrant explanations. In short, we are boundedly rational, but that's only half the story; we're also really really clever problem-solvers.

At some level, all leadership right now is crisis leadership - getting one's team and organization through unprecedented times. Sometimes the ability to lead through these changes is due to talent; other times, luck plays the more important role. Technological and political changes are upending assumptions and conventional wisdoms that have guided the world for decades. Tomorrow's business leaders need to navigate multiple dimensions and horizons in order to guide their organizations to success: they need to excel in strategy and execution, understanding details and context, navigating digital and physical, and many other dualities. This course explores how leaders at the world's leading companies are driving frame-breaking transformational change inside of organizations that have grown up with a physical foundation, or who have a digital foundation and are moving into the physical domain as a new entrant. The issues facing business leaders across multiple industries require insights on how to drive technological, cultural and ecosystem changes under unprecedented duress. The changes brought about by these dynamics require the development of new types of leaders which we call Systems Leaders. These people seek to maximize and thrive in the chaos of the times. Systems Leaders are adept at systems thinking - in having the ability to analyze the complexity in markets and organizations by paying attention to how the component parts interrelate to each other. The course will delve into the need for systems thinking at multiple levels - of products, organizations, cultures and individuals.

397,STRAMGT 322:,Create a New Venture: From Idea to Launch II,"S321/S322 is an integrated lab course in Entrepreneurship designed to teach students the process of creating a new viable venture - from Idea to Launch.  It is a dynamic and interactive course organized around projects undertaken by teams of 3 to 4 registered students from the MSx and MBA programs, together with other graduate students from within Stanford who bring expertise of particular relevance to the idea being pursued, e.g. engineering, CS or medicine. This course is designed not only for students with immediate entrepreneurial aspirations but also for any student considering starting an entrepreneurial venture at some point in his or her career.  The course is a two-quarter class, with admission to the class by team and idea. In the winter quarter, teams will research, craft, test and morph their idea into a viable business concept. In the spring quarter, they will further test, refine their concept and develop a strategy and plan to attract financial, human and other resources. At the end of the spring quarter, teams will present their plan to a panel of experts and potential investors to simulate the funding process.  The course builds on important research, successes, and findings as they relate to the process of new venture creation. The teaching method is through a structured process of relevant mini-lectures, exercises and active in-depth team learning by doing (LBD). Extensive field research and prototype product development are integral to the course. Learning is further enhanced through meetings with the instructor, coaching by their assigned experienced mentors, experts, and review by peers.

398,STRAMGT 325:,Impact: From Idea to Enterprise,"This class is for students who want start or work at an impact venture, or to invest in or grant to such an enterprise. The class deals with situations from the perspective of the entrepreneur/manager, and the funder. Students will: -- Learn to evaluate impact and business opportunities in social enterprises -- Understand the potential tension between impact and revenue/profit in impact enterprises and how to manage it -- Start, grow, and manage a team and a board of directors for a social enterprise -- Become versed in the landscape of impact funders -- Be introduced to how entrepreneurs create social change -- Be exposed to the personal journeys and careers of impact entrepreneurs. For purposes of this course an impact venture is an organization whose mission is to provide a sustainable solution to a social problem. -- The focus on mission makes impact enterprises different in kind from commercial enterprises. That said, it is the instructors' views that, in most ways, impact ventures should be treated and managed like commercial ventures, and this course reflects this perspective. Even so, there are some important differences which are critical to understand to effectively launch, manage or fund an impact enterprise. We will highlight these throughout our sessions. All the cases and class discussions will be exclusively about enterprises and organizations in the impact venture space, some for-profit, and some non-profit, but all run more or less like commercial businesses, e.g., the enterprise focus is on delivering solutions for 'customers' or 'recipients' to solve a social problem, create value and generating revenue (and/or profit). Impact: From Idea to Enterprise is integrative and will allow students to apply many facets of their business school education. We will have a mixture of case discussions, lectures, student-led exercises, panel discussions, and guest speakers. The final project involves engagement with a current impact venture and its management. The instructors, Laura Hattendorf and Russell Siegelman, are both Lecturers in Management at GSB with practical experience in the startup and impact venture space.",Win,3,"; Siegelman, R.

In this class, we will analyze the economics and strategy of marketplaces. We will consider the forces that have led to the proliferation of these marketplaces, as well as the strategic choices that determine which ones succeed. We will also study the strategy of managing these marketplaces: how should matching work, how marketplace design can solve problems of congestion or market thinness, how to discover prices through auctions, and how to get feedback and design a well-functioning rating system. We will also talk about trust and safety as a key pillar of successful marketplaces. We will also learn how to design non-monetary markets that solve big social problems, such as kidney exchange, food banks, public housing, and school choice. Finally, we will discuss the regulatory challenges of these marketplaces, especially with regard to labor income and platform's monopoly power. Applications include online stores; ride-sharing and transportation; advertising and sponsored search; room-sharing and vacation rentals; creator/passion economy; B2B marketplaces; dating; and labor markets.

The Venture capital ecosystem is going through a dramatic cycle as venture capital investment dropped by a third from 2021 into 2022, and then another third from 2022 to 2023. Together with accelerating interest in Generative AI and the aftereffects from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, it is a challenge for both the entrepreneur and the investor. We believe there is opportunity within that chaos and our course is designed to show you how to navigate and stand out in the current environment. Our course gives you that tactical edge with a special combination of two class projects, guest speakers and case-based instruction. You will be able to apply what you learn as we (and the guest speakers) offer candid and instant feedback. The course is fast paced with very current content. You will hear from over 15 investors and a half dozen entrepreneurs. The course is designed to complement other popular GSB courses about entrepreneurship such as Start-up Garage, Formation of New Ventures, and Lean Launchpad. Notably, students are permitted to use the same business idea in our course's team project that they use for those courses (with instructor permission). If you do not have a business idea or market sector interest, we will team you with another student with similar interests. We offer class topics that are typically not covered in other business school courses - such as how to find and use the power of early stage advisors and board members in building and funding a company, how to find that ideal co-founder and figure out the equity split amongst the founding team, and what do VCs say behind closed doors at the VC's partners' meeting after the founder gives their funding pitch? We encourage challenging and meaningful class discussion to take the guests off-script and focus on sharing the street smarts of the entrepreneur and investor community. The course attracts students from diverse backgrounds (we intentionally reserve 10 seats for graduate students from outside the GSB). Students range in experience from serial entrepreneurs to students who are experimenting with entrepreneurship for the first time.

And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing 'the middle of the value chain.' This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems? The class is taught be Steve Davis, Senior Advisor at McKinsey & Company, Senior Advisor at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and former CEO of PATH, IDRI, and Corbis. We take an interdisciplinary approach to look at the factors that pull innovation forward, push it from behind, and (often to the world's detriment) block its successful implementation and scaling. First grounding the discussion in research on innovation and social change, we then apply business principles, real world experiences and several important case studies in global health to examine the way good ideas get stuck, and how good ideas can turn into innovation that matters. We focus on root causes for failure, success factors, and business practices and tools to enable millions of lives to be impacted by social innovation. The seminar combines lectures, case studies, visiting practitioners and team projects focused on the business case for scaling specific social innovations. The goal is to help the next generation of social innovation leaders think more about some of the mistakes of the past, lessons for the future, and new ways of approaching old problems, all from a practitioner's point of view.",Spr,3,"; Davis, S.

420,STRAMGT 511:,Protecting Ideas,"Today, the assets of many businesses are largely intangible, such as brands, data, software and trade secrets. More and more we live in an economy based on intangibles and much of business involves creating, exploiting and managing those intangible assets. Intellectual property rights (patents, trade secrets, copyright, trademarks design rights and so on) and data rights are a set of legal rights and assets that establish ownership of and protect tangible and intangible assets from copying and other acts for example copying of software or counterfeiting of designer handbags. Equally, intellectual property in the hands of third parties may pose a risk to a business developing a new product or brand. Most businesses start with an idea. It is critical to understand when and under what circumstances ideas, creative works and technology can be protected from third party use by intellectual property, and what limits apply to that protection. It is equally critical to recognize what must be done to secure ownership. In this course you will learn about IP rights-what they are, what they do, their limitations and how they are useful from a strategic perspective-well beyond the typical idea of a patent being nothing more than an invitation to a messy and expensive lawsuit. We will also discuss the all-too-common mistakes that can frustrate these objectives. To put these issues into a business setting, we will be joined by experienced business executives and investors in markets ranging from biosciences to software to sound engineering.  This course is designed for business students, not law students. It is the objective of this course to help business students to think critically about when and how to invest in intellectual property protection, to recognize its limits, and to avoid the common mistakes that can frustrate such investments and undermine the value of the company. Although we will have to introduce you to legal concepts, the focus of the course is on putting these concepts into a business setting and explaining how IP may be used strategically-enabling you to be part of the conversation with legal and intellectual property experts and to consider how IP can support management of the assets and strategy of a business or other enterprise. No prior knowledge or experience with intellectual property is needed. The format of this course is under review for best adaption to the possibility of distance learning but will include reading before each class, live or recorded presentations by the guest speakers, and Q&A and discussion. Guest speakers will share their experiences in the areas of IP investment, management, deployment, strategy and risk.",Last offered: Autumn 2020,2,
421,STRAMGT 512:,The Yin and Yang of Family Business Transitions,"This seminar provides students with practical solutions to some of the challenges faced in family business transitions.Family businesses are by far the dominant form of commerce world-wide, albeit the majority are small ""mom and pop shops."" Some research shows that large businesses, whatever the form of ownership, have an average lifespan of around forty years, while small businesses (at least in Japan and Europe) average around twelve years. So, if businesses in general do not survive, then it is a wonder that any family business can survive from one generation to another, let alone two, three, four or more.There are three essential requirements to succeed in a family business transition. First, it may seem obvious that the business must succeed, but it is less obvious what advantages a family business has over its non-family-owned counterparts. Second, the ownership structure must effectively maintain family cohesion and support the business. Finally, family members need to organize in thoughtful ways to work effectively with one another.The beauty of a family business is that it can be more profitable than companies with non-family ownership. Two fundamentals, at least, provide this advantage - a strong value system and a long-term economic perspective. The operative word above, however, is ""can""; it is by no means a foregone conclusion that a family business will be more successful. Families must thoughtfully develop their advantages, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that are inherent in any family business.Accordingly, this course is offered for students whose families own a family business or who are interested in the special challenges faced by family businesses. International students are encouraged to register as different cultural perspectives to family business will enrich the experience for everyone. Particular focus will be given to the transitions from one generation to another and the lessons learned that can be applied during the entire life of the business.",Aut,2,"; Francis, P.

422,STRAMGT 514:,Product/Market Fit,"The premise of this course is the success of a startup (and even a large company launching a new product) is most dependent on finding a market that is desperate for its product. Focusing on product/market fit conflicts with the conventional view that a startup's limited resources should be applied to perfecting the execution of day to day activities. Interestingly almost every successful product driven technology company followed a similar path to find its product/market fit, but it was usually by accident. In this course we attempt to define the consistent process each successful company pursued, which in most cases is highly counterintuitive, and how to apply it to different situations. Our class highlights the potential conflict between pursuing a conventional approach and optimizing product/market fit.  In order to really bring out this conflict, we employ a seminar format with only 25 students so every issue can be evaluated in detail. Our lessons are limited to information technology-based companies, but we have been told they may be more broadly applicable.  That being said, this course has been designed for someone who is truly interested in technology-based entrepreneurship.  Students who choose to take this course must be committed to read all the assigned articles and books to have the proper foundation to address the frequent counterintuitive learnings. In some cases that might require an entire (although relatively short) book be read for an individual class. A written assignment addressing at least one of the learnings from each reading will be required to be submitted at least four hours prior to each class. Failure to submit even one of the written assignments will result in a U. In addition to the daily written assignments, there will be a large individual project required at the end of the course. In other words, this course requires far more commitment than a typical GSB course, especially for one that offers only two credits.  However I promise this course will be invaluable should you choose an operating or investment career in the technology business.","Win, Spr",2,"; Rachleff, A. (PI); Vrionis, J.

423,STRAMGT 516:,Fundamentals of Effective Selling,"The primary objective of this course is to introduce students to the fundamentals of how to sell.  The course is appropriate for anyone who wants to understand and show proficiency with the skills required in different selling situations, both traditional (i.e., direct sales of products and services) and non-traditional (e.g., selling oneself in an interview, raising money for a new venture, convincing a job candidate to join your company, etc.).  The course looks at the entire selling process of prospecting, qualification, discovery, understanding value, customizing presentations, objection handling, and closing. This not a typical GSB case-study-based course.  Students who have taken previous versions of this class describe it as a practical, hands-on, skills-based class.  Students will work by themselves outside of class to prepare for group exercises and role-plays that will take place in class.  These exercises are designed to give students practice with selling fundamentals in each stage of the selling process, and to give them the opportunity to observe and provide feedback to others.  Our goal is to provide students the time in class to focus on doing stuff (e.g., practice using curiosity) rather than just thinking about and talking about stuff. After taking this course, you should understand what is involved in all of the following steps of the selling process - Preparing a value-based prospecting script. - Using an advanced questioning methodology and note-taking strategy for discovering a customer's most important business priorities and motivations. - Developing a curiosity-based approach to handling objections in all stages of the selling process. - Creating and delivering effective customized presentations. - Understanding the most effective ways to create engagement and interaction when selling. - Developing a strategy and building the confidence to ask the hard questions when closing a deal. - Using a value-based mutual plan to control the sales cycle and move a deal forward. - Identifying the most valuable categories for qualifying an opportunity. - Accelerating the process of relationship building. - Understanding a customer's entire decision making process (DMP). - Discovering limiting beliefs and seeing how they impact your ability to accomplish your objectives. - 	Applying these fundamentals of effective selling to your personal selling situations with confidence.",Aut,2,"; Lattin, J.

Yet, critical IP decisions are usually made by lawyers with very little input from management. The purpose of this class is to provide business leaders with the tools, models and institutional knowledge to actively participate in managing and growing their company's IP assets as strategic business assets (with a focus on patents). This class will explore the value of corporate IP assets by thinking strategically on how to effectively leverage the knowledge, trade secrets, patents, technologies, trademarks, structures and processes that are critical across industries. We will focus on the elements of a successful IP strategy, and how that strategy is shaped by economic, technology, legal, regulatory, and market factors. Through a combination of case studies (including a group strategy project), analysis of current events, class discussion and guest speakers, we will cover a variety of issues shaping a successful IP strategy in today's global business environment. Some of the topics covered include: * Building and managing an IP portfolio that is aligned with business objectives;* Understanding the forces shaping the IP marketplace in the US and in foreign markets;* The innovation cycle and technology transfer mechanisms;* Using big data analytics in making IP decisions;* IP portfolio monetization strategies (e.g., licensing, sale, enforcement);* IP considerations in Mergers & Acquisitions;* IP valuation and current trends in patent transactions;* Managing corporate IP litigation risk (patent trolls, incumbent litigation);* IP strategies for start-ups & entrepreneurs.Ms. Efrat Kasznik is an IP valuation and strategy expert with more than twenty years of experience advising companies of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 100s, on extracting value from their IP.

Does our education system have what it takes to produce graduates who are prepared for college, career, and citizenship in our increasingly digital and pluralistic world?  Will income and ethnic achievement gaps continue to be pervasive and persistent in our nation's largest urban cities? Will family zip code determine educational destiny for the next generation of students? Which strategies and reforms are truly demonstrating results and which are merely passing fads? As in all large-scale enterprises undergoing rapid, transformative change, leadership matters greatly.  Fortunately, over the last decade, the reform of American public education has been led by a number of innovative and results-oriented leaders at the state, district and charter levels.  These leaders are bringing additional urgency, strategies, and ideas designed to prepare America's schools and students for the century ahead.  Some ideas are proving to be critical levers for change, others are facing significant political challenges, and others have not delivered on expected results.  Many of them hold lessons for how future educational leaders can contribute to transforming public education for the next generation of K-12 students.  This course will focus on school system leadership for education reform. The course will provide an overview of the critical issues facing K-12 public education in America today, and what is going on across the U.S. during this transformative period of change.  Once this context is set, students will study education leaders and systems change strategies from the last 10-15 years at the state, district and charter levels.  We will focus on leaders across five domains: Leadership in crisis situations, strategic leadership, 'china-breaking' leadership, sustaining leadership, and next generation leadership.  We will also look at leadership examples from outside K-12 education to broaden our thinking about what leadership styles and strategies could be successfully applied to education.  Students will debate the strategies and efficacy of how different leaders approached systems-level change and will form their own working hypotheses of what is needed to help transform the American education system.  Case studies in school system leadership will form the primary basis for classroom assignments and discussion.  We will examine what went right and what went wrong in each case, focusing particularly on the decisions that school system leaders faced and the implications of their decisions.  Most cases will be supplemented with research publications, technical notes, news clips, and/or videos to deepen students' understanding of the context or issues discussed in the cases.

434,STRAMGT 546:,Startup Garage: Research Driven Inspiration,"This is a hands-on, project-based course in which students will learn the Research Driven Inspiration (RDI) process and utilize the framework to explore an area they choose to build expertise and uncover insights and opportunities. If you are interested in starting a company or gaining invaluable expertise for career advancement, RDI is a powerful approach. The RDI process was pioneered by Scott Brady, and its origin story is captured well in the ProjectSHED case. It is a curiosity-centric, structured approach to obtaining a complete picture of an industry or space through research and discussions with industry experts. Those who follow the RDI process stand on the shoulders of thought leaders, stakeholders, and experts to uncover patterns, identify gaps, and understand the big, impactful, non-obvious problems of an industry and the current and future opportunities surrounding them. Over the last few years, the framework has been formalized by Scott and Brett Jordan, and over 300 students have followed the process, resulting in numerous companies and impressive career opportunities. The output of this class would also be an excellent input for courses that focus on further fleshing out potential opportunities, such as Startup Garage.  Note: Teams generally have better experiences and outcomes with the RDI process than individuals, provided the groups form organically around shared topic interest and compatibility. While students cannot register as teams, we strongly encourage them to form teams before or in the early stages of the course. You are also welcome to collaborate with students outside the class.

435,STRAMGT 547:,Riding The Next Wave in Developing Economies,"Today, innovative ventures in developing economies are providing compelling new products and services to a growing middle-class as well as to the lower part of the economic pyramid. These offerings provide consumers ways to better their lives and companies to grow their businesses. As older industries around the world are being disrupted, and entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing economies are evolving, entrepreneurs and investors now have reference points and ""base camps"" to explore unique opportunities. These newly formed networks that include universities, incubators, accelerator programs, angel investor organizations and small venture capital firms are still lacking in breadth and depth, despite their attempts to follow the lead of Silicon Valley. Consequently, investors and founders face distinct and more numerous challenges that they would not encounter in Silicon Valley, such as small local markets, lack of scale-up funding, uncertain exit opportunities, inadequate talent pools and complex legal and political environments. Yet these developing economies are growing and becoming more connected. We are witnessing new technology-based products in these locations allowing problems to be solved at a scale never seen before. AI and machine learning, blockchain, smart sensors, IoT devices, natural language  interfaces and AR and VR are just a few of the technologies not only being developed in Silicon Valley, but all over the world. Of course, smartphones, with their multi-faceted sensors, are now becoming ubiquitous. These trends present opportunities such as: replicating business models proven elsewhere; leapfrogging legacy technologies; targeting the base of the pyramid; and starting venture capital firms. Despite this fertile ground for new endeavors, success not only requires an exceptional product/market fit but great execution to start and scale a venture in problematic and sometimes adverse environments. This case-driven course is designed to help students identify new opportunities in developing economies around the world and across industries and to expose them to the challenges they will face. It is targeted at students who are thinking about creating, joining or investing in new ventures in developing economies. The cases and guests will reveal entrepreneurial challenges through the eyes of founders and investors who have seized these opportunities at different stages of the venture: ideation, launch and scaling. This course is designed to showcase innovative companies in high growth industries such as consumer internet, financial services, health care and education.

Students will learn from the instructors, course peers, and class visitors, particularly top current search entrepreneurs, CEOs, and investors. This course is designed to assist students who are seriously pursuing a search fund. Those who have taken Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) or researched search funds extensively, including holding discussions with current searchers, investors, and CEO's, will benefit the most from this advanced, experiential course. By the end of the course, students will be prepared to or will already have raised search capital and launched their search, if they choose to do so. The course is not a good fit for students who do not know the basics of search funds (such as from taking S543) or are not likely to pursue a search fund upon or within a few years of graduation. Pursuing self-developed work plans that target the aspects of the search fund path most relevant to them at the time of the course, students will target industry segments and business models, evaluate investors, structure their search entity, set up their search process and outreach materials, perhaps begin to contact business owners, and develop wisdom about what makes a deal attractive or unattractive, among other experiences. Students will hear from class guests, including current searchers, standing CEO's of search-acquired companies, active investors, and former searchers (some of whom ""failed"" at buying a company) in order to inform their various decisions as they pursue a search fund. Each student will receive feedback on how they can be a more effective search fund entrepreneur. Teams of two are fine but not necessary. Most students join the class as individuals and all will be graded individually.This course is offered by the Graduate School of Business. It builds on the processes taught in Entrepreneurial Acquisition (S543) and detailed in the Stanford Primer on Search Funds (2020).

This research-oriented course explores fundamental approaches to elevate LLMs toward AGI capabilities through conscious reasoning, planning, and decision-making. Core Research Questions: 1. How can we enable LLMs to transition from pattern matching to conscious deliberation? 2. What frameworks support robust reasoning and verifiable decisions? 3. How do we implement planning and temporal awareness in LLM systems? 4. What role does multi-LLM agent collaboration play in advancing toward AGI capabilities? The course examines: 1. Theoretical foundations of consciousness in AI 2. Multi-LLM Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI) frameworks 3. Entropy-guided information exchange 4. Constitutional AI principles 5. Temporal reasoning and planning architectures. Through lectures, discussions, and hands-on projects, students will explore practical implementations across various domains.

182,CS 421:,Designing AI to Cultivate Human Well-Being,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive us towards a better future for all of humanity, but it also comes with significant risks and challenges. At its best, AI can help humans mitigate climate change, diagnose and treat diseases more effectively, enhance learning, and improve access to capital throughout the world. But it also has the potential to exacerbate human biases, destroy trust in information flow, displace entire industries, and amplify inequality throughout the world. We have arrived at a pivotal moment in the development of the technology in which we must establish a foundation for how we will design AI to capture the positive potential and mitigate the negative risks. To do this, building AI must be an inclusive, interactive, and introspective process guided by an affirmative vision of a beneficial AI-future. The goal of this interdisciplinary class is to bridge the gap between technological and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human well-being? The ultimate aim is to provide tools and frameworks to build a more harmonious human society based on cooperation toward a shared vision. Thus, students are trained in basic science to understand what brings about the conditions for human flourishing and will create meaningful AI technologies that aligns with the PACE framework: 1) has a clear and meaningful purpose, 2) augments human dignity and autonomy, 3) creates a feeling of inclusivity and collaboration, 4) creates shared prosperity and a sense of forward movement (excellence).

And how does immigration change a nation's racial landscape? This graduate course surveys classic and contemporary writings on race and ethnicity mainly within the sociological tradition. We begin with Weber and some non-canonized classics, including the works of W.E.B. DuBois and Franz Fannon to understand how the study of race and ethnicity emerged in Social Science as a contrast to the biological determinist scholarship of the time. We pay attention to the way that social scientists emphasized the role of culture, structure, and status. From there we proceed to examine the more contemporary arguments, including uncovering the various mechanisms that undergird the (re)production or transformation of racial and ethnic boundaries. We spend time examining the literature on inequality and questions about the significance of race and racism. In addition, we assess how assimilation and racialization developed over time. We then spend time thinking about how to consider race and ethnicity in research designs. Finally, we end with looking towards the future, including how technology is changing modern conceptualizations of race and the potential of policy to mitigate the effects of systemic racism.",Last offered: Winter 2024,1-3,
